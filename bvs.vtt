<i> There was a time above.</i>

2
00:00:20.187 --> 00:00:22.855
<i> A time before.</i>

3
00:00:22.857 --> 00:00:25.824
<i> There were perfect things,</i>

4
00:00:25.826 --> 00:00:28.127
<i> diamond absolutes.</i>

5
00:00:29.062 --> 00:00:31.530
<i> How things fall.</i>

6
00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.033
<i> Things on earth.</i>

7
00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:36.068
<i> And what falls...</i>

8
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.169
Master Wayne!

9
00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:39.004
<i> ...is fallen.</i>
Bruce!

10
00:00:41.042 --> 00:00:42.441
<i> Bruce, it's all right.</i>

11
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:46.378
<i> Bruce, please.</i>

12
00:03:09.656 --> 00:03:11.757
Martha.

13
00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:47.653
<i> In the dream,</i>
<i> they took me to the light.</i>

14
00:04:47.655 --> 00:04:49.554
<i> A beautiful lie.</i>

15
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.168
<i> Jack.</i>
Bruce.

16
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:37.936
Jack, listen to me.

17
00:05:37.938 --> 00:05:40.605
I want you to get everyone
out of the building right now.

18
00:05:40.607 --> 00:05:42.441
<i> You understand?</i>
Oh, my god.

19
00:05:42.443 --> 00:05:44.142
<i> Stay away</i>
<i> from the windows!</i>

20
00:05:44.144 --> 00:05:46.278
Let's go. Come on.
Start moving now, people.
Let's go.

21
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.380
The boss wants us
out of the building,
so let's make it happen.

22
00:05:48.382 --> 00:05:50.582
Jack. Jack!

23
00:07:30.716 --> 00:07:32.984
<i> We're sorry.</i>

24
00:07:32.986 --> 00:07:37.456
<i> All circuits are busy now.</i>
<i> Will you please</i>
<i> try your call again later?</i>

25
00:07:38.724 --> 00:07:40.358
Heavenly god,

26
00:07:41.394 --> 00:07:44.329
creator of heaven and earth,

27
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:46.031
have mercy on my soul.

28
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.702
Jack!

29
00:08:29.008 --> 00:08:31.977
Buddy hands!
Everybody show me!
Good job!

30
00:08:31.979 --> 00:08:33.712
Come on, guys.

31
00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.582
<i> Hold on tight.</i>

32
00:08:38.551 --> 00:08:40.018
<i> Come on, guys.</i>

33
00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.621
Go.

34
00:08:42.623 --> 00:08:43.855
<i> Mr. Wayne!</i>

35
00:08:43.857 --> 00:08:47.359
Mr. Wayne!
I can't feel my legs.

36
00:08:47.361 --> 00:08:48.793
I can't feel my legs.

37
00:08:48.795 --> 00:08:51.029
We need help over here!

38
00:08:51.031 --> 00:08:52.497
Help me.
I can't feel my legs.

39
00:08:52.499 --> 00:08:55.000
You're gonna be okay.
You hear me?

40
00:08:55.002 --> 00:08:57.402
Wallace? What do they
call you, Wally? Huh?

41
00:08:59.505 --> 00:09:00.639
You're the boss, boss.

42
00:09:02.208 --> 00:09:04.476
All right.
You're gonna be okay.

43
00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:06.011
Easy, easy. Come on.

44
00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.416
Oh, my god.
I can't move my leg.

45
00:09:11.418 --> 00:09:13.752
<i> My god.</i>
<i> I can't feel my legs.</i>

46
00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.995
It's okay.
You're gonna be okay.

47
00:09:23.997 --> 00:09:27.399
You're okay.
All right? Huh?

48
00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:29.000
You know what?
We're gonna find your mom.

49
00:09:29.002 --> 00:09:30.635
Where is she?

50
00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.193
All that wind is bad luck.

51
00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:37.228
Blood in the sky.

52
00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:38.763
Oh, there she is!

53
00:11:46.972 --> 00:11:48.239
Miss Lane.

54
00:11:49.709 --> 00:11:51.710
<i> Miss Lane. Jimmy Olsen.</i>

55
00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:53.878
Photographer. Obviously.

56
00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.313
Where's heron?

57
00:11:55.315 --> 00:11:57.115
Uh, trouble at the border.

58
00:11:59.251 --> 00:12:02.387
So, uh, how'd you land it?
This is, like, pioneer stuff.

59
00:12:02.389 --> 00:12:04.723
Amajagh's never given
an interview.

60
00:12:04.725 --> 00:12:07.792
You know what heron always
says when we're on
assignment together?

61
00:12:09.095 --> 00:12:10.662
Not a goddamn thing.

62
00:12:10.664 --> 00:12:12.797
I like heron.

63
00:12:26.378 --> 00:12:27.746
Let's go.

64
00:12:33.754 --> 00:12:36.521
<i> Passports.</i>
<i> Electronics. Phones. Camera.</i>

65
00:12:36.523 --> 00:12:39.090
Your fixer said that
the general approved photos.

66
00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.117
Um...

67
00:13:07.453 --> 00:13:10.922
Are you a terrorist,
general?

68
00:13:10.924 --> 00:13:13.758
They did not tell me
the interview
was with a lady.

69
00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.060
I'm not a lady.
I'm a journalist.

70
00:13:18.464 --> 00:13:22.100
<i> What I am</i>
<i> is a man with nothing</i>

71
00:13:22.102 --> 00:13:25.804
<i> except a love of my people.</i>

72
00:13:25.806 --> 00:13:27.806
Who's paying for these
security contractors,
general?

73
00:13:27.808 --> 00:13:30.708
Who pays for the drones
that pass over our heads
at night?

74
00:13:32.444 --> 00:13:34.112
<i> One question begs another.</i>

75
00:13:34.114 --> 00:13:35.780
<i> Yes?</i>

76
00:13:35.782 --> 00:13:37.615
<i> Say what you're</i>
<i> saying, general.</i>

77
00:13:37.617 --> 00:13:39.918
It's just a camera.

78
00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:42.821
The United States
has declared its neutrality
in your country's civil war

79
00:13:42.823 --> 00:13:45.790
both in policy and
in principle.

80
00:13:45.792 --> 00:13:48.560
Oh, don't open...
You just exposed...

81
00:13:50.931 --> 00:13:53.164
These pious
American fictions...

82
00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:54.833
<i> ...spoken like truth.</i>

83
00:13:54.835 --> 00:13:56.901
Okay. That's my film.

84
00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:06.110
Men with power obey
neither policy nor
principle, miss Lane.

85
00:14:09.215 --> 00:14:10.515
<i> No one is different.</i>

86
00:14:11.483 --> 00:14:13.618
No one is neutral.

87
00:14:23.329 --> 00:14:24.462
CIA.

88
00:14:25.497 --> 00:14:27.532
They're tracking us!

89
00:14:27.534 --> 00:14:29.434
You!

90
00:14:33.539 --> 00:14:34.873
You're CIA?

91
00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.407
What? No. No!

92
00:14:36.409 --> 00:14:38.543
You brought him here!
No, he's a photographer.

93
00:14:40.212 --> 00:14:41.880
No!

94
00:14:46.685 --> 00:14:48.253
It's okay, Lois.

95
00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:07.538
Talon's down, sir.

96
00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:09.741
Python, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

97
00:15:09.743 --> 00:15:11.910
Repeat, we have lost our
asset on the ground.

98
00:15:11.912 --> 00:15:14.913
There's still
a civilian in the compound.
We'll extract her.

99
00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:17.849
<i> Negative. Rpa to engage.</i>
<i> Stand down and get black.</i>

100
00:15:17.851 --> 00:15:21.185
There'll be friendlies
in the blast zone, so...

101
00:15:21.187 --> 00:15:23.388
Call off the goddamn drone.

102
00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.024
Stand down is an order.
Python?

103
00:15:26.026 --> 00:15:27.659
Let's move!

104
00:15:35.768 --> 00:15:37.535
I...

105
00:15:37.537 --> 00:15:38.970
I didn't know.

106
00:15:38.972 --> 00:15:43.942
Ignorance is not
the same as innocence,

107
00:15:43.944 --> 00:15:45.310
miss Lane.

108
00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:15.540
Get up! Stand up!

109
00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.821
Quickly. He's coming.

110
00:16:42.634 --> 00:16:44.669
Inbound 2 Mikes.

111
00:16:44.671 --> 00:16:47.171
<i> Passing python now.</i>

112
00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:56.414
Move out!

113
00:17:03.822 --> 00:17:06.524
Target locked.
You are clear to engage.

114
00:17:06.526 --> 00:17:08.226
Armed hot and in range.

115
00:17:13.132 --> 00:17:14.966
<i> Three.</i>

116
00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.903
Two. One.

117
00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:31.049
Link's been hit.

118
00:17:31.051 --> 00:17:32.617
By what?

119
00:17:37.057 --> 00:17:38.589
Take one step,

120
00:17:38.591 --> 00:17:40.491
you will see
the inside of her head.

121
00:19:04.276 --> 00:19:07.011
<i> The women</i>
<i> in the village heard a noise.</i>

122
00:19:08.013 --> 00:19:12.617
Like the sky cracked open.

123
00:19:12.619 --> 00:19:17.321
He came down.
Then came fire.

124
00:19:19.159 --> 00:19:21.659
<i> Even worse came after.</i>

125
00:19:21.661 --> 00:19:23.995
<i> The government attacked.</i>

126
00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:26.831
<i> No mercy in the villages.</i>

127
00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.400
My parents tried to run.

128
00:19:33.872 --> 00:19:37.208
The world has been
so caught up with
what superman can do

129
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:40.678
that no one has asked
what he should do.

130
00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:45.983
Let the record show
that this committee
holds him responsible.

131
00:19:45.985 --> 00:19:48.152
<i> He'll never</i>
<i> answer to you.</i>

132
00:19:48.154 --> 00:19:50.821
He answers to no one.

133
00:19:50.823 --> 00:19:53.291
Not even, I think, to god.

134
00:19:55.961 --> 00:19:57.495
<i> 58 to nothing.</i>

135
00:19:57.497 --> 00:19:59.697
<i> Metropolis, again,</i>
<i> blowing out Gotham city.</i>

136
00:19:59.699 --> 00:20:02.166
<i> Really, only the diehards</i>
<i> are left in the stands.</i>

137
00:20:02.168 --> 00:20:04.368
<i> Delta Charlie 27.</i>

142
00:20:11.678 --> 00:20:12.543
<i> Delta Charlie 27, respond.</i>

143
00:20:12.545 --> 00:20:14.845
Just take a knee.

144
00:20:14.847 --> 00:20:16.914
<i> They're lining up</i>

145
00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:19.150
<i>- Don't tell me, Dave.</i>
<i>- Going to the end zone!</i>

146
00:20:19.152 --> 00:20:21.352
<i>- This is unnecessary.</i>
<i>- Delta Charlie 27</i>

00:20:21.354 --> 00:20:23.187
<i>- Zeke Baker is open.</i>
<i>- Baker with a touchdown catch!</i>

<i> Do you copy?</i>

00:20:27.192 --> 00:20:28.759
10-4. We're on it.

151
00:20:28.761 --> 00:20:30.995
<i> And now</i>
<i> a fight breaks out.</i>

152

<i> Gotham city, you know</i>

<i> their football team.</i>

153
00:20:34.234 --> 00:20:37.201
<i> Things could get ugly</i>
<i> in the city tonight.</i>

154
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:20.611
Go.

155
00:21:32.124 --> 00:21:33.658
It's okay.

156
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:35.259
It's okay.

157
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.062
We're gonna help.
We're here to help.

158
00:21:38.064 --> 00:21:40.498
We're gonna get you
out of here. Okay?

159
00:21:50.509 --> 00:21:52.043
I don't understand.

160
00:21:56.782 --> 00:21:58.683
<i> Please don't.</i>
<i> Please don't.</i>

00:22:06.925 --> 00:22:10.528
<i> Please.</i>
<i> I don't know who he is.</i>

162
00:22:13.632 --> 00:22:15.032
<i> I don't know who he is!</i>

163
00:22:18.003 --> 00:22:19.870
<i> No!</i>

164
00:22:39.358 --> 00:22:41.258
<i> Oh, fuck.</i>

165
00:23:20.932 --> 00:23:22.533
Christ!

166
00:23:22.535 --> 00:23:24.101
I saw him.

167
00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:25.903
<i> I never saw him before.</i>
<i> I... I didn't know.</i>

168
00:23:25.905 --> 00:23:27.705
You almost
took my face off.

169
00:23:27.707 --> 00:23:30.141
How about you don't shoot
the good guys, huh?

170
00:23:30.742 --> 00:23:33.377
Oh. Oh.

171
00:23:33.379 --> 00:23:35.679
<i> Jesus Christ.</i>

172
00:23:35.681 --> 00:23:37.281
<i> He branded him.</i>

173
00:25:07.339 --> 00:25:09.173
Hey.
Hey.

174
00:25:09.175 --> 00:25:10.441
I was gonna cook.

175
00:25:10.443 --> 00:25:12.076
Surprise you.

176
00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:19.583
They held hearings
about what happened.

177
00:25:20.852 --> 00:25:22.319
<i> They're saying that...</i>
I don't care.

178
00:25:22.321 --> 00:25:24.722
I don't care
what they're saying.

179
00:25:26.358 --> 00:25:28.292
The woman I love could have
been blown up or shot.

180
00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:29.994
<i> Think of what</i>
<i> could have happened.</i>

181
00:25:29.996 --> 00:25:32.463
Well, think about
what did happen.

182
00:25:32.465 --> 00:25:34.865
I didn't kill those men,
if that's what they think.

183
00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:36.634
<i> If that's what</i>
<i> you're saying.</i>

184
00:25:36.636 --> 00:25:39.069
No, I'm saying
i want to understand
what happened.

185
00:25:40.839 --> 00:25:42.806
I'm saying thank you
for saving my life.

186
00:25:42.808 --> 00:25:44.608
<i> I'm saying there's a cost.</i>

187
00:25:53.552 --> 00:25:55.553
I just don't know
if it's possible.

188
00:25:56.688 --> 00:25:58.455
Don't know
if what's possible?

189
00:26:01.693 --> 00:26:03.761
For you to love me
and be you.

190
00:26:31.356 --> 00:26:32.756
Clark!

191
00:26:34.092 --> 00:26:36.360
Clark, you're going
to flood the apartment.

192
00:26:36.362 --> 00:26:38.529
Mmm-hmm.

193
00:27:11.296 --> 00:27:13.564
You still working?

194
00:27:13.566 --> 00:27:15.966
You're getting slow
in your old age, Alfred.

195
00:27:15.968 --> 00:27:19.336
Comes to us all,
master Wayne.

196
00:27:19.338 --> 00:27:22.039
Even you got
too old to die young.

197
00:27:23.575 --> 00:27:25.876
And not for lack of trying.

198
00:27:27.979 --> 00:27:30.280
<i> Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>
<i> Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>

199
00:27:30.282 --> 00:27:32.316
<i> Funnel-ferry butterbar.</i>
<i> Funnel-ferry...</i>

200
00:27:32.318 --> 00:27:34.485
There's nothing wrong
with the microphone.

201
00:27:34.487 --> 00:27:37.621
It's this new layer
of armor.

202
00:27:37.623 --> 00:27:39.556
I'll just have to rewire.

203
00:27:41.126 --> 00:27:45.996
So, last night
was productive?

204
00:27:45.998 --> 00:27:49.933
No. He's too low-level.
He knew nothing.

205
00:27:49.935 --> 00:27:52.369
This is the man
who knows things.

206
00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:56.273
Anatoli knyazev.
He's Russian.

207
00:27:56.275 --> 00:27:57.808
Contracts
all over the globe,

208
00:27:57.810 --> 00:27:59.176
<i> but he's based out of</i>
<i> the port of Gotham.</i>

209
00:27:59.178 --> 00:28:00.978
<i> Weapons and human</i>
<i> trafficking.</i>

210
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.846
<i> So the</i>
<i> white Portuguese</i>
<i> is a Russian.</i>

211
00:28:02.848 --> 00:28:04.982
<i> That's the theory.</i>

212
00:28:04.984 --> 00:28:09.620
No. The theory is that
the Russian will lead me
to the man himself.

213
00:28:09.622 --> 00:28:13.624
If he is, indeed,
a "him."

214
00:28:13.626 --> 00:28:15.025
You don't even know
if he exists.

215
00:28:15.027 --> 00:28:16.560
Could be a phantasm.

216
00:28:16.562 --> 00:28:19.797
One that wants to bring
a dirty bomb into Gotham?

217
00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:21.598
Ah, high-stakes round.

218
00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:26.570
<i> New rules.</i>

219
00:28:29.507 --> 00:28:31.175
We're criminals,
Alfred.

220
00:28:31.177 --> 00:28:33.711
We've always been criminals.
Nothing's changed.

221
00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:36.880
Oh, yes, it has, sir.

222
00:28:38.483 --> 00:28:40.117
Everything's changed.

223
00:28:44.856 --> 00:28:46.790
<i> Men fall from the sky.</i>

224
00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:50.394
The gods hurl thunderbolts.

225
00:28:51.262 --> 00:28:53.130
<i> Innocents die.</i>

226
00:28:54.365 --> 00:28:57.034
<i> That's how it starts, sir.</i>

227
00:28:57.036 --> 00:28:59.203
<i> The fever. The rage.</i>

228
00:28:59.205 --> 00:29:02.139
The feeling of
powerlessness.

229
00:29:04.042 --> 00:29:08.145
It turns good men cruel.

230
00:29:19.424 --> 00:29:22.092
<i> John, get d.</i>

231
00:29:22.094 --> 00:29:24.862
Ooh. Ah. Ahoy, ahoy!
I did not know you were here.

232
00:29:24.864 --> 00:29:26.930
Man on the marquee.
Yeah, don't believe it.

233
00:29:26.932 --> 00:29:28.565
My father named the company
after himself.

234
00:29:28.567 --> 00:29:30.768
He was the Lex in front of
the corp. How you doin'?

235
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:32.369
Oh, really great.

236
00:29:32.371 --> 00:29:34.938
Really great? Good. Good.
Uh, follow me.

237
00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.641
No, uh, dad started saying
that he named the company,

238
00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:39.443
uh, after his kid
at investor pitches.

239
00:29:39.445 --> 00:29:41.745
Rich old ladies. They thought
it was very cute, you know?

240
00:29:41.747 --> 00:29:43.614
"Write check for Lex."

241
00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:46.784
You know, dad was born
in east Germany.

242
00:29:46.786 --> 00:29:49.119
He grew up eating,
uh, stale crackers.

243
00:29:49.121 --> 00:29:51.321
And every other Saturday,
he had to march in a parade

244
00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:53.390
and wave flowers at tyrants.

245
00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:57.127
So, I think it was Providence
that his son, me,

246
00:29:57.129 --> 00:29:58.729
would end up with this.

247
00:29:58.731 --> 00:30:01.331
One of my rebuild Metropolis
crews found it.

248
00:30:01.333 --> 00:30:03.934
<i> Little souvenir from</i>
<i> the Kryptonian world engine.</i>

249
00:30:03.936 --> 00:30:05.769
What does a rock have to do
with homeland security?

250
00:30:05.771 --> 00:30:07.771
Homeland security? Hmm.

251
00:30:07.773 --> 00:30:11.475
No, no, no, ma'am,
planetary security.

252
00:30:11.477 --> 00:30:13.510
<i> The fragment</i>
<i> is of a radioactive</i>
<i> xenomineral.</i>

253
00:30:13.512 --> 00:30:16.313
<i> We suspected it might</i>
<i> have bio-interactions,</i>

254
00:30:16.315 --> 00:30:19.316
so we took the sample
to amriid,

255
00:30:19.318 --> 00:30:22.452
where they keep the remains
of the Kryptonian decedent.

256
00:30:22.454 --> 00:30:25.956
And, when we exposed
general Zod to the mineral,

257
00:30:25.958 --> 00:30:28.158
this happened.

258
00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.629
<i> Profound biodegradation.</i>
<i> Decaying Kryptonian cells.</i>

259
00:30:32.631 --> 00:30:34.164
We concluded the mineral
could be weaponized

260
00:30:34.166 --> 00:30:35.699
if a large enough
sample was found.

261
00:30:35.701 --> 00:30:39.336
And then, among the fishes,
a whale.

262
00:30:39.338 --> 00:30:40.838
<i> Ah!</i>

263
00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:43.340
<i> Lying at the bottom of</i>
<i> the Indian ocean.</i>

264
00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:45.509
Emerald city.

265
00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:47.444
<i> Beautiful.</i>

266
00:30:47.446 --> 00:30:49.012
<i> Now, rocky is radioactive,</i>

267
00:30:49.014 --> 00:30:52.115
but what he needs from you
is an import license.

268
00:30:52.117 --> 00:30:54.852
And why would we want to
weaponize this material?

269
00:30:54.854 --> 00:30:56.019
<i> As a deterrent.</i>

270
00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:57.521
A silver bullet
to keep in reserve,

271
00:30:57.523 --> 00:30:58.789
to use against
the Kryptonians,

272
00:30:58.791 --> 00:31:00.691
so the day does not come,
madam,

273
00:31:00.693 --> 00:31:02.492
when your children are waving
daisies at a reviewing stand.

274
00:31:02.494 --> 00:31:04.194
Last I looked,
the only one of those

275
00:31:04.196 --> 00:31:05.829
flying around up here
was superman.

276
00:31:05.831 --> 00:31:09.032
Ha-ha, yes. Superman.
Yeah, but there are, uh...

277
00:31:09.034 --> 00:31:10.467
<i> There are more of them.</i>

278
00:31:10.469 --> 00:31:11.835
The metahuman thesis.

279
00:31:11.837 --> 00:31:13.237
<i> Yes,</i>
<i> the metahuman thesis.</i>

280
00:31:13.239 --> 00:31:14.638
<i> More likely than not</i>

281
00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:16.740
these exceptional beings
live among us.

282
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:19.543
The basis of our myths.
Gods among men upon

283
00:31:19.545 --> 00:31:21.044
our little
blue planet here.

284
00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:25.182
Now, you don't have to use
a silver bullet.

285
00:31:25.184 --> 00:31:27.718
But if you forge one...

286
00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.419
Well, then

287
00:31:29.421 --> 00:31:32.089
we don't have to depend
upon the kindness of monsters.

288
00:31:36.361 --> 00:31:39.830
There are ways
we can help each other.

289
00:31:39.832 --> 00:31:42.065
Would you step
into my office here?

290
00:31:45.904 --> 00:31:47.704
Yes.

291
00:31:47.706 --> 00:31:49.473
What's your wish list?

292
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:53.610
Uh...

293
00:31:53.612 --> 00:31:56.113
Access to the wreck of
the crashed Kryptonian ship?

294
00:31:58.249 --> 00:31:59.449
Done.

295
00:32:48.566 --> 00:32:51.268
The complete remains
of the dead alien
for testing.

296
00:32:52.972 --> 00:32:54.204
You want Zod's body?

297
00:32:55.473 --> 00:32:56.873
Okay.

298
00:33:10.788 --> 00:33:13.657
Mmm.

299
00:33:32.610 --> 00:33:34.244
It's cherry.

300
00:33:36.848 --> 00:33:38.415
Mmm-mmm.

301
00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.152
<i> Because the time has come</i>

302
00:33:42.154 --> 00:33:45.455
<i> for the world to hear</i>

<i> Okay, but whose hero?</i>

304
00:33:48.694 --> 00:33:50.994
<i> If superman</i>
<i> were here right now,</i>

305

<i> what would you</i>

306
00:33:53.132 --> 00:33:55.532
<i> That my family,</i>

307
00:33:57.201 --> 00:33:59.369
<i> To look him in his eye</i>

308
00:33:59.371 --> 00:34:02.472
<i> and ask him</i>

<i> ...which lives count.</i>

310
00:34:04.642 --> 00:34:06.410
<i> And which ones do not.</i>

311
00:35:16.247 --> 00:35:18.014
Sir, get down.

312
00:35:19.617 --> 00:35:21.985
Sir, I said get down!

313
00:35:21.987 --> 00:35:25.455
<i> Now!</i>

314
00:35:25.457 --> 00:35:27.023
<i> Can we get some</i>
<i> backup here?</i>

315
00:35:27.959 --> 00:35:29.926
<i> Hey! Hey! Don't do it!</i>

316
00:35:29.928 --> 00:35:31.128
<i> Hey!</i>

317
00:35:33.464 --> 00:35:36.066

Oh, um, watch yourself
over there in Gotham.

323
00:35:50.282 --> 00:35:51.648
Don't let them

She hasn't been back.

Scared of who?

354

There's a new kind of
mean in him.

355
00:37:41.926 --> 00:37:43.526
He is angry.

356
00:37:45.129 --> 00:37:46.529

377
00:39:20.659 --> 00:39:22.058
Perry, when you
assign a story,

378
00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:23.827
you're making a choice
about who matters.

379
00:39:23.829 --> 00:39:25.195
And who's worth it.

380
00:39:25.197 --> 00:39:26.996
Good morning, Smallville.

381
00:39:26.998 --> 00:39:30.667
The American conscience died
with Robert, Martin, and John.

<i> Sorry. I'm sorry.</i>

383

No match.
My guys in the crime lab
never seen one before.

384
00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.410
It's called a bullet.
You shoot people with them.

385
00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:41.911
Recovered from the scene

388
00:39:45.884 --> 00:39:47.083
even black market.

00:39:47.085 --> 00:39:48.485
<i> So?</i>

390
00:39:48.487 --> 00:39:50.387
So who gave

to tuareg fighters
in the Sahara?

392

You're the reporter.
Tell me.

393
00:39:53.492 --> 00:39:55.258

<i> while claiming to support</i>
<i> the elected government.</i>

395
00:39:56.895 --> 00:39:58.561
The ask, Lois.

396
00:40:03.734 --> 00:40:05.268
Flight to D.C. tonight.
Couple of days there.

397
00:40:05.736 --> 00:40:06.836
Go.

398
00:40:06.838 --> 00:40:09.172
Coach. No extra legroom.

399
00:40:11.909 --> 00:40:13.009
Economy plus.

400
00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:14.277
Coach!

401
00:40:15.746 --> 00:40:17.914
So,
why didn't you tell me?

402
00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.185
You're digging up snakes, lo.

403
00:40:23.587 --> 00:40:25.188
It's kind of dangerous.

404
00:40:25.190 --> 00:40:27.123
That is why
i didn't tell you.

405
00:40:27.125 --> 00:40:28.525
Lane, don't you
have a plane to catch?

406
00:40:29.593 --> 00:40:30.660
Yes, sir.

407
00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.731
Benefit for
the library of Metropolis.

408
00:40:34.733 --> 00:40:37.767
Someone on the committee
requested that Clark Kent
cover it.

409
00:40:37.769 --> 00:40:41.004
Probably some old
charity crone who's got
a thing for nerds.

410
00:40:51.449 --> 00:40:52.782
<i> Senator.</i>

411
00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.452
Little bourbon before lunch?

412
00:40:55.454 --> 00:40:57.587
My driver's outside.
I can't stay.

413
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:59.456
No bourbon?

414
00:40:59.458 --> 00:41:00.957
Kentucky girl

415
00:41:01.826 --> 00:41:03.460
Hmm.

416
00:41:03.462 --> 00:41:06.329
My dad always said
that Kentucky mash

417
00:41:06.331 --> 00:41:08.298
was the secret to health.

418
00:41:08.300 --> 00:41:09.966
Mmm.

419
00:41:10.968 --> 00:41:12.402
This was his room.

420
00:41:14.472 --> 00:41:16.172
I kept it just the same.

421
00:41:18.242 --> 00:41:19.476
Mmm.

422
00:41:22.279 --> 00:41:25.815
"Maybe one day dad'll
come back if I just keep
everything the same."

423
00:41:25.817 --> 00:41:27.383
That is silly.

424
00:41:29.153 --> 00:41:31.488
The magical thinking
of orphan boys.

425
00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:34.224
I'm blocking the import
license for your mineral.

427
00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:47.604
The redcapes are coming.

428
00:41:47.606 --> 00:41:48.671
Hmm...

429
00:41:51.810 --> 00:41:53.209
You and your hearings.

430
00:41:57.214 --> 00:41:59.749
Galloping through
the streets to warn us.

431
00:42:01.485 --> 00:42:02.886
One if by land,

432
00:42:02.888 --> 00:42:04.888
two if by air.

433
00:42:04.890 --> 00:42:06.256
Mmm.

434
00:42:11.028 --> 00:42:14.030
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, senator?

435
00:42:14.032 --> 00:42:15.231
Can I call you June?

436
00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:18.034
You can call me
whatever you like.

437
00:42:18.036 --> 00:42:20.737
Take a bucket of piss and
call it granny's peach tea.

438
00:42:20.739 --> 00:42:22.305
Mmm-hmm.

439
00:42:22.307 --> 00:42:23.740
Take a weapon of
assassination

440
00:42:23.742 --> 00:42:25.441
and call it deterrence.

441
00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.212
You won't fool a fly or me.

442
00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:32.782
I'm not gonna drink it.

443
00:42:37.521 --> 00:42:39.822
You don't think
dad would mind, do you?

444
00:42:39.824 --> 00:42:44.761
If I changed just...
Just one thing in this room?

445
00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:49.599
Because that
should be upside-down.

446
00:42:51.735 --> 00:42:53.836
We know better now,
don't we?

447
00:42:53.838 --> 00:42:56.973
The devils don't come
from hell beneath us. No.

448
00:42:58.008 --> 00:43:00.109
No, they come from the sky.

449
00:44:56.393 --> 00:44:57.727
Oh.

450
00:44:57.729 --> 00:44:59.562
I hope the next generation
of waynes

451
00:44:59.564 --> 00:45:03.466
won't inherit
an empty wine cellar.

452
00:45:03.468 --> 00:45:06.602
Not that there's likely
to be a next generation.

453
00:45:07.871 --> 00:45:09.138
<i> Thank you, sir.</i>

454
00:45:12.177 --> 00:45:15.745
This is every call made
from the Russian's phone.

455
00:45:15.747 --> 00:45:18.214
Two mentions of business
with the white Portuguese.

456
00:45:18.216 --> 00:45:21.150
And it's continually
transmitting blacked-out data

457
00:45:21.152 --> 00:45:22.819
to the personal residence

458
00:45:22.821 --> 00:45:24.487
of Alexander Luthor.

459
00:45:24.489 --> 00:45:28.357
You think Lex Luthor
is the white Portuguese?

460
00:45:30.028 --> 00:45:32.361
I can't see that
he needs the income
from imported arms.

461
00:45:32.363 --> 00:45:34.397
Regardless, I'll need to put
a leech at his house,

462
00:45:34.399 --> 00:45:35.732
and I'm gonna
need the suit.

463
00:45:35.734 --> 00:45:37.834
The bat interrogated
six people

464
00:45:37.836 --> 00:45:39.836
and came away with nothing.

465
00:45:41.672 --> 00:45:43.906
It was Bruce Wayne
that got the information.

466
00:45:43.908 --> 00:45:47.076
Well, Bruce Wayne can't
break into Lex Luthor's house.

467
00:45:47.078 --> 00:45:48.811
Bruce Wayne won't have to.

468
00:45:50.681 --> 00:45:52.081
He's been invited.

469
00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.490
Who's that?

470
00:47:07.492 --> 00:47:09.926
You must be new to
the "let them eat cake" beat.

471
00:47:09.928 --> 00:47:12.695
That is Bruce Wayne.

00:47:26.543 --> 00:47:29.111
Nicky. Uh...

477
00:47:29.113 --> 00:47:31.347
<i> You're embarrassing me.</i>
<i> Um...</i>

478
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:33.382
<i> Speech, speech. Uh...</i>

479
00:47:33.384 --> 00:47:35.017
<i> Blah, blah, blah. Uh...</i>

480
00:47:35.719 --> 00:47:37.486
<i> Open bar.</i>

481
00:47:37.488 --> 00:47:39.488
<i> The end.</i>

482
00:47:39.490 --> 00:47:42.225
<i> Uh...</i>

483
00:47:42.227 --> 00:47:45.228
The word "philanthropist"
comes from the Greek.

484
00:47:45.230 --> 00:47:46.829
Meaning a lover
of humanity.

485
00:47:46.831 --> 00:47:49.899
<i> Uh, it was coined</i>
<i> about 2,500 years ago.</i>

486
00:47:49.901 --> 00:47:51.667
All right.
Where am I going, Alfred?

487
00:47:51.669 --> 00:47:53.836
Go past the elevator.

488
00:47:53.838 --> 00:47:55.371
Do a left.

489
00:47:56.173 --> 00:47:58.541
<i> That's right, must be.</i>

490
00:47:58.543 --> 00:48:00.877
<i> It's in the service corridor</i>
<i> in the basement.</i>

491
00:48:00.879 --> 00:48:02.345
<i> Go down the stairs.</i>

492
00:48:02.347 --> 00:48:04.647
<i> Gods and men.</i>
<i> Prometheus went with us.</i>

493
00:48:04.649 --> 00:48:07.383
And he ruined Zeus' plan
to destroy mankind,

494
00:48:07.385 --> 00:48:08.851
and for that he was
given a thunderbolt.

495
00:48:09.988 --> 00:48:12.221
<i> Hmm, that seems unfair.</i>

496
00:48:12.223 --> 00:48:15.224
<i> Um... on a serious note,</i>
<i> the library of Metropolis...</i>

497
00:48:15.226 --> 00:48:17.159
Go to the stairs.
You saw them on your way in.
Down the stairs.

498
00:48:17.161 --> 00:48:20.897
<i> But at one time,</i>
<i> dad could not buy them. No.</i>

499
00:48:20.899 --> 00:48:23.032
<i> My father could not afford</i>
<i> books growing up.</i>

500
00:48:23.034 --> 00:48:24.600
<i> He had to root through</i>
<i> the garbage for</i>
<i> yesterday's newspaper.</i>

501
00:48:27.005 --> 00:48:28.604
All right. You got
the kitchens on your right.

502
00:48:29.907 --> 00:48:31.540
<i> Do a left.</i>

503
00:48:31.542 --> 00:48:33.776
Right in front of you.
That's where you want to be.

504
00:48:50.460 --> 00:48:51.928
May I help you,
Mr. Wayne?

505
00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:54.297
Uh, I just...

506
00:48:54.299 --> 00:48:57.066
I thought the bathroom was
down here. I must have...

507
00:48:57.068 --> 00:49:00.770
That last Martini was
two too many, I think.

508
00:49:00.772 --> 00:49:02.238
Men's room is upstairs.

509
00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:03.839
Great. I'm okay.

510
00:49:04.775 --> 00:49:06.008
I like those shoes.

511
00:49:10.882 --> 00:49:12.782
I can't stay
down here, Alfred.

512
00:49:12.784 --> 00:49:14.250
<i> Go upstairs</i>
<i> and socialize.</i>

513
00:49:14.252 --> 00:49:15.952
Some young lady
from Metropolis

514
00:49:15.954 --> 00:49:17.286
will make you honest.

515
00:49:19.123 --> 00:49:21.324
In your dreams, Alfred.

516
00:49:21.326 --> 00:49:22.825
<i> Books are knowledge,</i>

517
00:49:22.827 --> 00:49:26.395
and knowledge is power,
and I am...

518
00:49:26.397 --> 00:49:27.997
No. Uh, um...

519
00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:31.000
No. What am I? I...
What was I saying? No.

520
00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.737
The bittersweet pain
among men

521
00:49:34.739 --> 00:49:38.607
is having knowledge with
no power, because...

522
00:49:38.609 --> 00:49:41.544
Because that is paradoxical!
And, um...

523
00:49:43.981 --> 00:49:45.982
Thank you for coming.

524
00:49:47.418 --> 00:49:49.018
<i> Please drink. Drink.</i>

525
00:49:57.861 --> 00:50:02.164
Mr. Wayne? Mr. Wayne?
Clark Kent, <i> daily planet.</i>

526
00:50:02.166 --> 00:50:04.266
Uh, my foundation has
already issued a statement

527
00:50:04.268 --> 00:50:06.335
in support of books.

528
00:50:06.337 --> 00:50:08.504
Sir?
Um...

529
00:50:08.506 --> 00:50:11.207
Wow. Pretty girl. Bad habit.
Don't quote me.

530
00:50:11.209 --> 00:50:12.875
All right?

531
00:50:12.877 --> 00:50:15.845
What's your position on
the bat vigilante in Gotham?

532
00:50:15.847 --> 00:50:18.547
<i> Daily planet.</i>
Do I own this one?
Or is that the other guy?

533
00:50:18.549 --> 00:50:22.151
Civil liberties are being
trampled on in your city.

534
00:50:22.153 --> 00:50:23.519
Good people
are living in fear.

535
00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:28.491
Don't believe everything
you hear, son.

536
00:50:28.493 --> 00:50:31.861
I've seen it, Mr. Wayne.
He thinks he's above the law.

537
00:50:34.998 --> 00:50:38.234
<i> The daily planet</i>
criticizing those who think
they're above the law

538
00:50:38.236 --> 00:50:42.405
is a little hypocritical,
wouldn't you say?

539
00:50:42.407 --> 00:50:45.174
Considering every time
your hero saves
a cat out of a tree,

540
00:50:45.176 --> 00:50:47.476
you write
a puff piece editorial

541
00:50:47.478 --> 00:50:50.212
about an alien who,
if he wanted to,

542
00:50:50.214 --> 00:50:52.982
could burn
the whole place down.

543
00:50:52.984 --> 00:50:55.818
There wouldn't be
a damn thing we could
do to stop him.

544
00:50:57.854 --> 00:51:00.890
Most of the world doesn't
share your opinion, Mr. Wayne.

545
00:51:00.892 --> 00:51:04.360
Maybe it's
the Gotham city in me.

546
00:51:04.362 --> 00:51:05.828
We just have a bad history

547
00:51:05.830 --> 00:51:07.596
with freaks
dressed like clowns.

548
00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.100
<i> Boys!</i> <i> Um!</i>

549
00:51:11.102 --> 00:51:13.702
Bruce Wayne meets
Clark Kent. Ha!

550
00:51:13.704 --> 00:51:15.704
I love it. I love bringing
people together.

551
00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:16.739
How are we?

552
00:51:16.741 --> 00:51:18.507
Lex.
Hello. Good.

553
00:51:18.509 --> 00:51:21.010
Hi, hello, Lex,
it is a pleasure. Ow!

554
00:51:21.012 --> 00:51:22.611
Wow! That is a good grip!

555
00:51:22.613 --> 00:51:25.414
You should not pick a fight
with this person. Huh.

556
00:51:25.416 --> 00:51:27.716
So, after all these years,
we finally got you
over to Metropolis.

557
00:51:27.718 --> 00:51:29.885
Well, I thought
I'd come drink you dry.

558
00:51:29.887 --> 00:51:31.887
Well, you're welcome.
You should hop the harbor
more often, though.

559
00:51:31.889 --> 00:51:33.222
I'd love to show you
my labs.

560
00:51:33.224 --> 00:51:35.691
Maybe we could
partner on something.

561
00:51:35.693 --> 00:51:38.594
My r and d is up to
all sorts of no good.

562
00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.966
That's seven minutes.

563
00:51:43.968 --> 00:51:45.267
<i> Looks like</i>
<i> the transfer's complete.</i>

564
00:51:46.470 --> 00:51:47.770
Mr. Luthor.
Yes?

565
00:51:47.772 --> 00:51:49.605
The governor.
Governor.

566
00:51:49.607 --> 00:51:51.107
Excuse me.
Next time.

567
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:52.441
Governor! Hi!

568
00:51:52.443 --> 00:51:54.143
Lex, it's good to see you.

569
00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:33.482
Excuse me.

570
00:53:39.716 --> 00:53:42.218
<i> We, as a population</i>
<i> on this planet,</i>

571
00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:43.719
<i> have been looking</i>
<i> for a savior.</i>

572
00:53:43.721 --> 00:53:46.155
<i> 90% of people believe</i>
<i> in a higher power,</i>

573
00:53:46.157 --> 00:53:47.590
<i> and every religion believes</i>

<i> in some sort of</i>
<i> messianic figure.</i>

575

<i> And when this savior character</i>
<i> actually comes to earth,</i>

576
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:55.064
<i> we want to make him abide</i>
<i> by our rules?</i>

577
00:53:55.066 --> 00:53:57.199
<i> We have to understand that</i>
<i> this a paradigm shift.</i>

578
00:53:57.201 --> 00:53:59.735
<i> We have to start thinking</i>
<i> beyond politics.</i>

579
00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:02.404
<i> Are there</i>
<i> any moral constraints</i>
<i> on this person?</i>

580
00:54:02.406 --> 00:54:04.406
<i> We have international law.</i>

581
00:54:04.408 --> 00:54:07.576
<i> On this earth,</i>
<i> every act is a political act.</i>

582
00:54:07.578 --> 00:54:09.411
<i> Is it really surprising</i>

583
00:54:09.413 --> 00:54:11.780
<i> that the most powerful man</i>
<i> in the world</i>

585
00:54:14.952 --> 00:54:17.519
<i> Uh, to have</i>

<i> in these state-level</i>

<i> should give us all pause.</i>

588

<i> Human beings</i>
<i> have a horrible track record</i>

589

<i> of following people</i>

<i> huge human atrocities.</i>

00:54:30.268 --> 00:54:32.801

<i> in our own image.</i>

593

<i> we project ourselves</i>
<i> onto him.</i>

594
00:54:36.274 --> 00:54:39.975
<i> The fact is, maybe he's</i>
<i> not some sort of devil</i>

595
00:54:39.977 --> 00:54:42.444
<i> Maybe he's just a guy</i>

596
00:54:42.446 --> 00:54:45.614
Neil degrasse Tyson:
<i> We're talking about a being</i>
<i> whose very existence</i>

597
00:54:45.616 --> 00:54:50.152

<i> sense of priority</i>
<i> in the universe.</i>

598
00:54:50.154 --> 00:54:51.620
<i> And you go back</i>
<i> to copernicus,</i>

599
00:54:51.622 --> 00:54:53.122
<i> where he restored the sun</i>

<i> in the center of</i>
<i> the known universe,</i>

<i> And you get to</i>
<i> darwinian evolution,</i>

<i> we're just one among</i>

<i> Are you,</i>
<i> as a United States senator,</i>

<i> No. Nothing. I just...</i>

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:22.044
Well, he just...

629
00:56:22.046 --> 00:56:24.546
You know how he was.

630
00:56:24.548 --> 00:56:26.548
"What do I need
to travel for?

631
00:56:26.550 --> 00:56:28.117
"I'm already there."

632
00:56:30.487 --> 00:56:32.121
Just wish
it was more simple.

633
00:56:34.824 --> 00:56:36.225
My baby boy.

634
00:56:38.061 --> 00:56:40.462
Nothing was ever simple.

635
00:56:47.837 --> 00:56:49.438
An odd little duck.

636
00:56:51.608 --> 00:56:52.908
<i> Hmm!</i>

637
00:56:52.910 --> 00:56:54.309
I've never seen
a metal like this.

638
00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:59.214
Could be darpa black box.

639
00:56:59.216 --> 00:57:00.883
Who could find out?

640
00:57:00.885 --> 00:57:02.851
Nobody who'd want to.

641
00:57:02.853 --> 00:57:05.721
Maybe they gave them
out to the rebels
to test in theater.

642
00:57:05.723 --> 00:57:08.924
Using live soldiers
as Guinea pigs?

643
00:57:08.926 --> 00:57:11.794
This is what makes you
such a good reporter.

644
00:57:11.796 --> 00:57:13.095
Stuff like this
still shocks you.

645
00:57:35.785 --> 00:57:37.119
It don't come off!

646
00:57:37.121 --> 00:57:39.221
It don't come off!

647
00:57:39.223 --> 00:57:41.457
Prisoner transfer!

648
00:57:41.459 --> 00:57:43.725
You can't put me
in general, man.
They gonna kill me.

649
00:57:43.727 --> 00:57:45.327
Hey, you can't bring me
to general.

650
00:57:45.329 --> 00:57:46.628
You should be thanking
the tax payers of Metropolis

651
00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:48.397
for taking in your
branded ass.

652
00:57:48.399 --> 00:57:49.998
Sign here, please.
I'm marked, man.

653
00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:51.633
You know what they do
to people with this on them?

654
00:57:51.635 --> 00:57:53.168
He's only a criminal.

655
00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:54.670
This way! Let's go!
They're gonna kill me!

656
00:57:54.672 --> 00:57:55.971
<i>- They're gonna kill me!</i>
- Let's go!

657
00:57:55.973 --> 00:57:57.072
Keefe.

658
00:57:57.074 --> 00:57:58.807
You made bail.

659
00:57:58.809 --> 00:57:59.875
Open two.

660
00:58:05.615 --> 00:58:06.849
Who paid?

661
00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:20.329
Who the hell are you?

662
00:58:25.835 --> 00:58:27.202
Just a man.

663
00:58:27.204 --> 00:58:29.404
Yeah? Well, what the fuck
do you want?

664
00:58:34.477 --> 00:58:35.677
To help you
stand for something.

665
00:58:40.984 --> 00:58:42.618
Your three o'clock's here.

666
00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:55.264
He made me half a man.

667
00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:58.901
My wife

668
00:58:58.903 --> 00:59:01.103
walked out on me.

669
00:59:03.139 --> 00:59:06.275
I can't even piss
standing up.

670
00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:08.944
<i> Let me face him.</i>

671
00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:12.414
You'll take care of it?

672
00:59:14.083 --> 00:59:15.284
Good.

673
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:41.977
What?

674
01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:02.431
Wrong room, miss.

675
01:00:02.433 --> 01:00:03.899
Secretary swanwick,

676
01:00:03.901 --> 01:00:05.367
you haven't been
returning my phone calls.

677
01:00:07.303 --> 01:00:09.438
Miss Lane, if you'd
like an interview,

678
01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.074
major farris is
just outside that door.

679
01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:13.976
You're treating me
like a stranger?

680
01:00:15.545 --> 01:00:17.446
I'm treating you
like a reporter.

681
01:00:17.448 --> 01:00:21.216
All right. Is the us
providing experimental
military arms

682
01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:23.051
to rebels in Africa?

683
01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:25.621
You know,
with balls like yours,

684
01:00:25.623 --> 01:00:27.556
you belong in here.

685
01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:30.759
What's your source on this?
A tin foil hat?

686
01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.794
No, not tin.
But it's metal.

687
01:00:32.796 --> 01:00:34.630
Fired in
the superman incident.

688
01:00:34.632 --> 01:00:37.065
Experts at
the Pentagon can't ID it.

689
01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:38.300
We haven't been
told the truth.

690
01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:39.601
Here's the truth.

691
01:00:39.603 --> 01:00:41.069
A reporter got greedy
for a scoop

692
01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.471
and went where
she shouldn't have.

693
01:00:42.473 --> 01:00:44.640
Superman acted like
some rogue combatant

694
01:00:44.642 --> 01:00:47.309
to rescue her,
and people died.

695
01:00:47.311 --> 01:00:50.045
Don't invent a conspiracy
theory to put back his halo.

696
01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:52.481
Or yours.

697
01:00:53.650 --> 01:00:54.983
- Major.
<i>- Sir.</i>

698
01:00:56.185 --> 01:00:57.619
<i> So.</i>

699
01:00:57.621 --> 01:01:00.155
I logged into your dropbox
to find copy.

700
01:01:00.157 --> 01:01:02.524
There's copy all right.

701
01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:06.461
But nothing about football.
Nothing about, uh,

702
01:01:06.463 --> 01:01:09.765
the friends of
the Metropolis library,

703
01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.668
just the goddamn
Gotham bat thing

704
01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:14.703
I told you not to pursue.

705
01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.705
If the police won't help,
the press has to do
the right thing.

706
01:01:16.707 --> 01:01:18.607
You don't get to decide
what the right thing is.

707
01:01:18.609 --> 01:01:21.009
When the <i> planet</i> was founded,
it stood for something, Perry.

708
01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.846
And so could you
if it was 1938,
but it's not 1938.

709
01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:28.116
Wpa ain't hiring no more.
Apples don't cost a nickel.

710
01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:31.119
Not in here, not out there.
You drop this thing!

711
01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:36.425
Nobody cares about Clark Kent
taking on the Batman.

712
01:01:38.661 --> 01:01:40.462
<i> So apparently superman</i>

713
01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.831
<i> doesn't want us</i>
<i> to think of him as</i>
<i> American anymore.</i>

714
01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:44.232
<i> And really,</i>
<i> why would we?</i>

715
01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:46.168
<i> Aside from the</i>
<i> red and blue costume.</i>

716
01:01:46.170 --> 01:01:47.969
<i> And, I don't know,</i>
<i> the fact that he has</i>

717
01:01:47.971 --> 01:01:50.472
<i> one-third of the usa's</i>
<i> initials on his chest.</i>

718
01:01:50.474 --> 01:01:52.074
<i> I assume the only reason</i>
<i> he's not wearing</i>

719
01:01:52.076 --> 01:01:55.043
<i> the declaration of</i>
<i> independence as a cape is...</i>

720
01:01:55.045 --> 01:01:56.678
<i> He thinks it's</i>
<i> too on-the-nose.</i>

721
01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:58.647
<i> What is going on</i>
<i> back here?</i>
No.

722
01:01:58.649 --> 01:02:00.182
Guys, come on.
Let's go.

723
01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:01.650
<i> Get yourselves together</i>
<i> and get out there.</i>

724
01:02:01.652 --> 01:02:03.051
<i> Get those glasses</i>
<i> on those trays.</i>

725
01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:03.919
<i> We got thirsty people</i>
<i> out there.</i>

726
01:02:13.096 --> 01:02:14.896
I wonder,
would you excuse us?

727
01:02:14.898 --> 01:02:17.733
There's something
I'd like to show you.
I'm sorry.

728
01:02:17.735 --> 01:02:21.036
Now some scholars insist
that it never happened...

729
01:02:21.038 --> 01:02:23.038
But I believe
it's the action

730
01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.909
perfectly in keeping
with a king who was
also a psychopathic killer.

731
01:02:27.911 --> 01:02:31.680
For me, it's the culmination
of 40 years curating.

732
01:02:31.682 --> 01:02:34.683
And I can't believe it,
but I've finally got it here.

733
01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:38.019
It's the sword of Alexander.

734
01:02:39.422 --> 01:02:42.324
It's the blade that
cut the gordian knot.

735
01:02:44.861 --> 01:02:46.228
It's a triumph.

736
01:02:46.230 --> 01:02:47.696
Yes.

737
01:02:47.698 --> 01:02:49.097
<i>- Enjoy.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

738
01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.473
It's a fake.

739
01:02:58.475 --> 01:03:01.276
The real one was sold
in '98 on the black market.

740
01:03:01.278 --> 01:03:02.444
And now it hangs...

741
01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.780
Over the bed of
the sultan of hajar.

742
01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.684
Excuse me.

743
01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.721
Excuse me, miss.

744
01:03:12.723 --> 01:03:15.957
The other night
you took something that
doesn't belong to you.

745
01:03:15.959 --> 01:03:18.126
Stealing's not polite.

746
01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.796
Is it stealing if you steal
from another thief?

747
01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.266
Who are you?

748
01:03:24.268 --> 01:03:26.835
Someone interested
in the same man you are.

749
01:03:27.837 --> 01:03:29.771
Is that right?

750
01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:32.841
I believe Mr. Luthor
has a photograph
that belongs to me.

751
01:03:32.843 --> 01:03:34.342
Did you get it?

752
01:03:34.344 --> 01:03:36.845
As it happens,
no, I didn't.

753
01:03:36.847 --> 01:03:39.981
The data you copied has
military-grade encryption.

754
01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:43.518
You know,
i bet with that dress,

755
01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.454
9 out of 10 men will let you
get away with anything.

756
01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.956
But you're the 10th?

757
01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:50.358
I'm guessing I'm the first

758
01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:52.727
to see through that
babe-in-the-woods act.

759
01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.463
You don't know me,

760
01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:57.098
but I've known
a few women like you.

761
01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:03.538
Oh, I don't think you've ever
known a woman like me.

762
01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:08.310
You know, it's true what
they say about little boys.

763
01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:11.079
Born with no natural
inclination to share.

764
01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:14.516
I didn't steal your drive.

765
01:04:14.518 --> 01:04:16.785
I borrowed it.

766
01:04:16.787 --> 01:04:19.754
You'll find it in the glove
compartment of your car.

767
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:22.090
Mr. Wayne.

768
01:06:15.338 --> 01:06:16.471
Did you get it?

769
01:06:16.473 --> 01:06:17.806
The rock?

770
01:06:17.808 --> 01:06:19.140
Yeah, we got it.

771
01:06:44.934 --> 01:06:46.034
I'm sorry.

772
01:06:47.704 --> 01:06:50.705
Get down! Get down now!

773
01:07:06.522 --> 01:07:07.622
No!

774
01:09:01.804 --> 01:09:03.505
She was my world.

775
01:09:05.141 --> 01:09:07.041
And you took her from me.

776
01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.521
<i> Bruce!</i>

777
01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:22.590
Bruce! Listen to me now!

778
01:09:25.861 --> 01:09:27.996
It's Lois!

779
01:09:27.998 --> 01:09:29.931
It's Lois Lane!

780
01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.200
<i> She's the key!</i>

781
01:09:34.003 --> 01:09:36.604
Am I too soon?

782
01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.508
I'm too soon!

783
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:42.844
<i> You're right about him!</i>

784
01:09:42.846 --> 01:09:45.680
<i> You've always</i>
<i> been right about him!</i>

785
01:09:45.682 --> 01:09:48.049
Fear him! Fear him!

786
01:09:48.851 --> 01:09:49.951
Find us, Bruce!

787
01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.620
<i> You have to find us!</i>

788
01:10:56.919 --> 01:10:59.020
<i> The</i> white Portuguese
<i> is not a man.</i>

789
01:10:59.022 --> 01:11:00.121
<i> It's a ship.</i>

790
01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:06.027
Master Wayne,
since the age of seven

791
01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.096
you have been
to the art of deception

792
01:11:08.098 --> 01:11:10.698
as Mozart to
the harpsichord.

793
01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:14.469
But you've never been
too hot at lying to me.

794
01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:19.374
The <i> white Portuguese</i> is not
carrying a dirty bomb.

795
01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:21.009
<i> What is it carrying?</i>

796
01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:23.544
It's a weapon.

797
01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.114
It's a rock.

798
01:11:26.116 --> 01:11:29.717
A mineral capable of weakening
Kryptonian cells.

799
01:11:29.719 --> 01:11:31.452
<i> The first sample big enough</i>
<i> to mean something</i>

800
01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.488
turned up in the Indian ocean
three months ago.

801
01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.456
It is now aboard
the <i> white Portuguese</i>

802
01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.959
being delivered to
Lex Luthor.

803
01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.994
Who I am going
to steal it from.

804
01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:41.929
To keep it out
of Luthor's hands.

805
01:11:41.931 --> 01:11:43.197
To destroy it.

806
01:11:44.633 --> 01:11:45.700
No.

807
01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.905
You're gonna go to war?

808
01:11:50.907 --> 01:11:56.911
That son of a bitch brought
the war to us two years ago.

809
01:11:56.913 --> 01:12:00.515
Jesus, Alfred. Count the dead.
Thousands of people.

810
01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:04.619
What's next? Millions?

811
01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:07.288
He has the power to wipe out
the entire human race,

812
01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:09.857
and if we believe
there's even a 1% chance
that he is our enemy,

813
01:12:09.859 --> 01:12:13.027
we have to take it
as an absolute certainty.

814
01:12:13.029 --> 01:12:14.429
And we have to destroy him.

815
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.098
But he is not our enemy.

816
01:12:17.933 --> 01:12:19.967
Not today.

817
01:12:19.969 --> 01:12:22.670
20 years in Gotham, Alfred.

818
01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.605
We've seen
what promises are worth.

819
01:12:25.808 --> 01:12:27.442
How many good guys are left.

820
01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:30.511
How many stayed that way.

821
01:12:33.449 --> 01:12:34.949
14 hours.

822
01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:40.054
My name is Clark Kent.
I'm from the <i> daily planet.</i>

823
01:12:43.692 --> 01:12:48.029
I'm trying to find out
what happened to an inmate,
a Santos.

824
01:12:48.031 --> 01:12:49.597
I can't give out
that information.

825
01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:08.549
Mommy!

826
01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.889
Mrs. Santos?

827
01:13:14.891 --> 01:13:17.358
<i> May I ask you</i>
<i> a few questions?</i>

828
01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:19.160
He wasn't my husband.

829
01:13:19.162 --> 01:13:20.561
But I know what he did.

830
01:13:21.697 --> 01:13:23.865
But he was a father.

831
01:13:23.867 --> 01:13:25.833
He was that, too.

832
01:13:25.835 --> 01:13:27.435
They took him
out of Gotham central.

833
01:13:27.437 --> 01:13:29.670
They moved him
to Metropolis.

834
01:13:29.672 --> 01:13:31.572
But inside they know.

835
01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.075
They know the mark all over.
Guards don't care.

836
01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.476
Bat's the judge.

837
01:13:36.545 --> 01:13:38.246
One man decides who lives.

838
01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:40.748
How is that justice?
Talk to me.

839
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:43.785
Help me change it.
With what? Your pen?

840
01:13:43.787 --> 01:13:46.721
A man like that,
words don't stop him.

841
01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:48.189
You know stops him?

842
01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.124
A fist.

843
01:13:54.096 --> 01:13:55.363
<i> Kent, I want</i>
<i> to talk to you.</i>

844
01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.434
Kent!

845
01:13:59.436 --> 01:14:01.602
Where does he go?
Where does he go, Jenny?

846
01:14:01.604 --> 01:14:03.604
I don't...
I don't know.

847
01:14:03.606 --> 01:14:04.806
Clicks his heels
three times,

848
01:14:04.808 --> 01:14:06.507
goes back to Kansas,
i suppose.

849
01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:09.577
Son of a...

850
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:22.824
<i> Turn it!</i>

851
01:14:22.826 --> 01:14:24.358
<i> Turn it!</i>

852
01:15:07.803 --> 01:15:09.237
Move out!

853
01:15:45.073 --> 01:15:46.307
Go, go, go, go!

854
01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:26.414
No!

855
01:17:51.466 --> 01:17:52.867
Where is he?

856
01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:15.449
Next time they shine
your light in the sky,

857
01:19:15.451 --> 01:19:17.284
don't go to it.

858
01:19:17.286 --> 01:19:19.687
The bat is dead. Bury it.

859
01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:22.590
Consider this mercy.

860
01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:26.193
<i> Tell me.</i>

861
01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:32.133
<i> Do you bleed?</i>

862
01:19:40.776 --> 01:19:42.109
<i> You will.</i>

863
01:21:24.379 --> 01:21:27.214
I don't have a halo over me,
Mr. secretary.

864
01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.250
I went into the desert,
people died.

865
01:21:29.252 --> 01:21:31.385
It keeps me awake.
It should.

866
01:21:37.192 --> 01:21:38.893
If you think that superman
is a murderer,

867
01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:40.895
then throw it away.

868
01:21:40.897 --> 01:21:42.796
But I don't believe
you think that.

869
01:21:45.867 --> 01:21:48.903
<i> How do we determine</i>
<i> what's good?</i>

870
01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:51.739
In a democracy,
good is a conversation,

871
01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:54.608
<i> not a unilateral decision.</i>

872
01:21:54.610 --> 01:21:57.278
So I urge superman to come

873
01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.079
<i> to this hill of the people</i>
<i> tomorrow</i>

874
01:21:59.081 --> 01:22:01.782
<i> to see those</i>
<i> who have suffered.</i>

875
01:22:01.784 --> 01:22:05.052
<i> The world needs to know</i>
<i> what happened in that desert.</i>

876
01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:07.554
<i> And to know</i>
<i> what he stands for.</i>

877
01:22:07.556 --> 01:22:09.757
<i> How far will he</i>
<i> take his power?</i>

878
01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:15.162
<i> Does he act by our will</i>
<i> or by his own?</i>

879
01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.839
<i> People hate</i>
<i> what they don't understand.</i>

880
01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:31.111
But they see what you do,
and they know who you are.

881
01:22:32.614 --> 01:22:35.950
You're not a killer,
a threat.

882
01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:39.687
I never wanted this world
to have you.

883
01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:46.493
Be their hero, Clark.
Be their monument.

884
01:22:46.495 --> 01:22:48.495
Be their angel.

885
01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:50.364
Be anything
they need you to be.

886
01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.800
Or be none of it.

887
01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:56.804
You don't owe
this world a thing.

888
01:22:57.973 --> 01:22:59.640
You never did.

889
01:23:02.077 --> 01:23:05.346
<i> This is deniros.</i>
<i> Transfer available</i>
<i> to Kane Avenue.</i>

890
01:23:05.348 --> 01:23:06.814
<i> Please, mind your step.</i>

891
01:23:36.811 --> 01:23:39.113
<i> I have to speak</i>
<i> to the senator today.</i>

892
01:23:39.115 --> 01:23:40.681
<i> You cannot</i>
<i> see the senator today.</i>

893
01:23:40.683 --> 01:23:42.182
<i> I need to speak to her</i>
<i> before the hearing.</i>

894
01:23:42.184 --> 01:23:44.118
<i> Do you understand</i>
<i> how important this is?</i>

895
01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.652
<i> I cannot</i>
<i> let you see the senator.</i>

896
01:23:45.654 --> 01:23:47.454
<i> Please,</i>
<i> I need to speak to her.</i>

897
01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:50.357
<i> Please, madam. I beg of you!</i>
<i> Please don't do this!</i>

898
01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.859
<i> This is so important!</i>

899
01:23:51.861 --> 01:23:54.395
<i> Come with me.</i>
<i> Don't touch me!</i>

900
01:23:54.397 --> 01:23:56.597
Please!
I'm sorry.
She wouldn't leave.

901
01:23:58.366 --> 01:24:01.168
I didn't tell you
the truth.

902
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:04.071
C.I. Thinks
the desert was a setup.

903
01:24:04.073 --> 01:24:06.240
Somebody wanted superman
to look guilty.

904
01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:09.043
The bullet?

905
01:24:17.419 --> 01:24:18.886
The metal was developed
by a private company.

906
01:24:18.888 --> 01:24:20.187
What company?

907
01:24:20.189 --> 01:24:21.789
Lexcorp.

908
01:24:22.891 --> 01:24:24.725
Lex Luthor?

909
01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:27.094
He also had private
security contractors
at the desert compound.

910
01:24:31.533 --> 01:24:33.033
Go on record.

911
01:24:33.035 --> 01:24:36.737
Not a chance.
It's classified.

912
01:24:36.739 --> 01:24:37.938
I happen to like my job.

913
01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.706
It doesn't make sense.

914
01:24:39.708 --> 01:24:41.775
You said that the ambush was
arranged to frame superman,

915
01:24:41.777 --> 01:24:44.111
but how could they know
that he'd show up in the...

916
01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:52.953
In the middle of the desert.
Thank you.

917
01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:59.860
The senate hearing is
expected to get underway
any minute now.

918
01:24:59.862 --> 01:25:02.096
And of course the big
unknown in all of this is

919
01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:03.597
will superman show up?

920
01:25:03.599 --> 01:25:04.598
That is what they're really
waiting to see.

921
01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:05.899
Mr. keefe. Mr. keefe.

922
01:25:05.901 --> 01:25:07.434
Soledad o'brien,
<i> in the moment.</i>

923
01:25:07.436 --> 01:25:08.936
Quick question for you.

924
01:25:08.938 --> 01:25:10.304
You're heading in
to meet with the senators.

925
01:25:10.306 --> 01:25:12.106
What will you tell them?

926
01:25:12.108 --> 01:25:15.042
<i> I've come here</i>
<i> to tell them to wake up.</i>

927
01:25:15.044 --> 01:25:17.211
<i> This is flesh and blood.</i>

928
01:25:17.213 --> 01:25:18.645
<i> He has delivered a war here.</i>

929
01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:20.881
<i> And this...</i>

930
01:25:20.883 --> 01:25:22.249
<i> This is what war looks like.</i>

931
01:25:22.251 --> 01:25:24.418
<i> I have nothing.</i>

932
01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:26.787
<i> There are plenty of people,</i>
<i> sir, who would say</i>
<i> he's their hero.</i>

933
01:25:26.789 --> 01:25:28.455
<i> He is not a hero.</i>

934
01:25:28.457 --> 01:25:31.458
Grace, can you get
Greg up here, please?

935
01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.660
Right now.

936
01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:35.729
An anonymous source
can verify everything

937
01:25:35.731 --> 01:25:37.464
I told you about what
happened in nairomi.

938
01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:40.100
An anonymous source?
<i> Run it.</i>

939
01:25:40.102 --> 01:25:42.236
Luthor engineered
the desert.

940
01:25:42.238 --> 01:25:44.404
It was an ambush
for superman.

941
01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:45.973
Trust your reporter.
Think Watergate.

942
01:25:45.975 --> 01:25:48.108
<i> Yeah, and you need to</i>
<i> think litigate.</i>

943
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:50.644
<i> If you're wrong,</i>
<i> Luthor will sue the paper</i>
<i> out of existence.</i>

944
01:25:50.646 --> 01:25:51.812
<i> You need proof.</i>

945
01:25:51.814 --> 01:25:53.347
No. It needs to run now.

946
01:25:53.349 --> 01:25:55.015
<i> Before the hearing.</i>

947
01:25:55.017 --> 01:25:56.517
<i> If superman knows,</i>
<i> it might change what he says.</i>

948
01:25:56.519 --> 01:25:58.785
I am not going to
risk the paper

949
01:25:58.787 --> 01:26:00.487
so that you can
pass notes in class

950
01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:01.755
to the man
that rescued you.

951
01:26:01.757 --> 01:26:03.323
McGraw: <i> He paid her?</i>

952
01:26:03.325 --> 01:26:06.126
Not only paid her.
He threatened her.

953
01:26:06.128 --> 01:26:08.529
Gave her a script
to learn.

954
01:26:08.531 --> 01:26:11.298
Her parents
are alive back home.

955
01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.300
But the girl's
got a conscience.

956
01:26:13.302 --> 01:26:16.170
He's been using the committee
as his puppet theater.
Senator!

957
01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:18.338
Hi, you.

958
01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:19.706
Don't go anywhere.
I want to talk to you.

959
01:26:19.708 --> 01:26:21.708
Uh, you know what?
Mercy, you go in

960
01:26:21.710 --> 01:26:23.877
and make sure
no one takes my seat.

961
01:26:23.879 --> 01:26:25.145
So what you been up to?

962
01:26:25.147 --> 01:26:26.947
I'm just here
to tell my story.

963
01:26:26.949 --> 01:26:28.482
That I was willing to finance
a Kryptonian deterrent,

964
01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:30.150
but a certain junior senator
from Kentucky

965
01:26:30.152 --> 01:26:32.219
decided to block it.

966
01:26:32.221 --> 01:26:35.856
Yes, the chair of
the committee on superman
is soft on security.

967
01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:38.525
Greg, why hasn't he
been getting our checks?
He is, Mr. Wayne.

968
01:26:38.527 --> 01:26:41.195
He gets a check from
the victims fund every month.

969
01:26:41.197 --> 01:26:43.697
He returns them.

970
01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.232
<i> ...who lost both his legs</i>

971
01:26:45.234 --> 01:26:47.701
<i> in those horrific events</i>
<i> in Metropolis</i>

972
01:26:47.703 --> 01:26:49.403
<i> that happened</i>
<i> two years ago.</i>

973
01:26:49.405 --> 01:26:50.604
Jesus.

974
01:26:52.674 --> 01:26:54.341
Why haven't I seen this?

975
01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:56.376
<i> I'm sorry.</i>
<i> I'll get to the bottom of it.</i>

976
01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:59.079
<i> And there he is.</i>
<i> Superman is here.</i>

977
01:26:59.081 --> 01:27:01.348
<i> He is actually</i>
<i> at the United States capitol.</i>

978
01:27:01.350 --> 01:27:03.483
<i> This is really</i>
<i> a historic moment.</i>

979
01:27:03.485 --> 01:27:05.819
<i> Now we expect that</i>
<i> superman will give</i>

980
01:27:05.821 --> 01:27:07.888
<i> some kind of a statement</i>
<i> to the senate,</i>

981
01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:10.624
<i> to the American people,</i>
<i> and, of course, to the world.</i>

982
01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:12.893
He's here. He came.

983
01:27:12.895 --> 01:27:15.395
He's above the capitol.
Ah.

984
01:27:15.397 --> 01:27:18.065
You are gonna be on the
hot seat in there, junebug.

985
01:27:18.067 --> 01:27:19.733
I grew up on a farm.

986
01:27:19.735 --> 01:27:22.202
I know how to wrestle a pig.

987
01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:24.404
Do you know the oldest lie
in America, senator?

988
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:27.307
It's that power
can be innocent.

989
01:27:29.410 --> 01:27:30.644
Good luck.

990
01:28:06.547 --> 01:28:08.715
Oh, miss...

991
01:28:08.717 --> 01:28:10.517
Rudy, she's good to go.

992
01:28:18.960 --> 01:28:20.060
Get out!

993
01:28:23.331 --> 01:28:26.166
Get out! Get out!
Superman! Superman!

994
01:28:33.274 --> 01:28:35.375
Another one came
this morning, Mr. Wayne.

995
01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:17.484
Let me say at the outset
that I'm grateful
to our witness

996
01:29:17.486 --> 01:29:20.354
for coming before us today.

997
01:29:20.356 --> 01:29:23.123
This is how
a democracy works.

998
01:29:23.125 --> 01:29:25.859
We talk to each other.

999
01:29:25.861 --> 01:29:31.365
We act by the consent
of the governed, sir.

1000
01:29:31.367 --> 01:29:34.701
<i> I have sat here before</i>
<i> to say that</i>
<i> shadow interventions</i>

1001
01:29:34.703 --> 01:29:37.704
<i> will not be tolerated</i>
<i> by this committee.</i>

1002
01:29:37.706 --> 01:29:39.239
<i> Neither will lies.</i>

1003
01:29:40.875 --> 01:29:44.311
Because today
is a day for truth.

1004
01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.781
Because only by speaking...

1005
01:29:58.226 --> 01:30:02.396
Only by working together
can we...

1006
01:30:08.503 --> 01:30:09.770
Can we...

1007
01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:23.016
Can we create a free,
and a...

1008
01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.346

01:31:39.694 --> 01:31:40.927
<i> Excuse me.</i>

1012
01:31:41.829 --> 01:31:44.164
Excuse me, officer.

1013
01:31:44.166 --> 01:31:46.666
Member of the press.
Can you let me in, please?

1014
01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:56.209
Breathe slowly
and deeply.

1015
01:31:56.211 --> 01:31:57.911
You're gonna be fine.

1016
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:10.357
Thank you. I'm gonna need
a little room to work.

1017
01:32:10.359 --> 01:32:13.827
<i> Ma'am, it appears you've</i>
<i> suffered a head injury.</i>

1018

01:35:04.366 --> 01:35:06.533

<i> failed to stop him.</i>

1044
01:35:12.340 --> 01:35:14.808
I didn't see it, lo.

1045
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:16.876
I was standing right there
and I didn't see it.

1046
01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:18.545
Clark, there are people
behind this.

1047

I'm afraid I didn't see it
because I wasn't looking.

All this time,

1049
01:35:26.354 --> 01:35:28.922
I've been living my life

Superman was never real.

1053
01:35:43.105 --> 01:35:45.805
Just the dream of a farmer
from Kansas.

1054

That farmer's dream
is all some people have.

It's all that gives
them hope.

01:42:01.382 --> 01:42:03.282
<i> Chief among them,</i>
<i> whether superman</i>
<i> was involved</i>

1095
01:42:03.284 --> 01:42:05.051
<i> in the planning</i>
<i> of this attack.</i>

1096
01:42:05.053 --> 01:42:07.320
<i> I mean, here's an individual</i>
<i> who has unlimited power,</i>

1097
01:42:07.322 --> 01:42:10.456
<i> yet did nothing to stop</i>
<i> the bomber just a few feet</i>
<i> away from him.</i>

1098
01:42:10.458 --> 01:42:13.126
<i> It just doesn't add up</i>
<i> for investigators.</i>

1099
01:42:13.128 --> 01:42:14.627
<i> Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

1100
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:17.196
<i> Burn him, burn him, burn him.</i>

1101
01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.555
For twenty American,
he didn't see you.

1102
01:42:43.690 --> 01:42:44.757
Same for me.

1103
01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:59.172
<i> Now one FBI official</i>
<i> familiar with this case</i>

1104
01:42:59.174 --> 01:43:01.340
<i> told me they found quote,</i>

1105
01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:04.777
<i> "a jackpot of bomb-making</i>
<i> materials inside</i>
<i> keefe's apartment."</i>

1106
01:43:04.779 --> 01:43:07.113
<i> What they need to</i>
<i> determine now is</i>

1107
01:43:07.115 --> 01:43:09.849
<i> whether he had any help</i>
<i> in the planning and execution</i>
<i> of the bombing.</i>

1108
01:43:09.851 --> 01:43:12.051
<i> And they haven't</i>
<i> ruled out the idea</i>

1109
01:43:12.053 --> 01:43:15.154
<i> that superman</i>
<i> was a co-conspirator.</i>

1110
01:43:15.156 --> 01:43:19.859
<i> Now, my sources are telling me</i>
<i> they are getting a barrage of</i>
<i> anonymous and credible tips</i>

1111
01:43:19.861 --> 01:43:22.295
<i> with all roads</i>
<i> in this investigation</i>

1112
01:43:22.297 --> 01:43:24.730
<i> leading to the</i>
<i> Kryptonian visitor.</i>

1113
01:44:01.769 --> 01:44:03.903
All right, Lois.
You gotta go.

1114
01:44:20.587 --> 01:44:22.488
He didn't know
he was gonna die.

1115
01:44:24.258 --> 01:44:25.758
He just bought groceries.

1116
01:44:25.760 --> 01:44:27.960
The wheelchair and
the bullet from the desert

1117
01:44:27.962 --> 01:44:29.729
were made from
the same metal.

1118
01:44:29.731 --> 01:44:31.297
I know. The desert.
The hearing.

1119
01:44:31.299 --> 01:44:34.200
Everywhere superman goes,
Luthor wants death.

1120
01:44:34.202 --> 01:44:36.469
<i> But,</i>
<i> Luthor goes through</i>
<i> all of that trouble...</i>

1121
01:44:36.471 --> 01:44:37.903
Creates a bomb
out of a wheelchair,

1122
01:44:37.905 --> 01:44:39.805
and then alters it
to reduce the blast?

1123
01:44:39.807 --> 01:44:41.641
What do you mean?

1124
01:44:41.643 --> 01:44:44.277
The inside of the chair
was lined with lead.

1125
01:44:46.780 --> 01:44:48.414
You couldn't stop it.

1126
01:44:48.416 --> 01:44:50.683
You couldn't see it.

1127
01:45:33.193 --> 01:45:34.593
Something, isn't it?

1128
01:45:36.463 --> 01:45:38.431
We men of Kansas
live on a pancake,

1129
01:45:38.433 --> 01:45:40.032
so we come to the mountains.

1130
01:45:41.535 --> 01:45:45.338
All downhill from here,
down to the floodplain.

1131
01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:47.239
Farm at the bottom
of the world.

1132
01:45:49.176 --> 01:45:52.211
I remember one season
the water came bad.

1133
01:45:52.213 --> 01:45:54.146
I couldn't have been 12.

1134
01:45:54.148 --> 01:45:57.149
Dad had out the shovels
and we went at it all night.

1135
01:45:57.151 --> 01:45:59.318
We worked till,
i think, I fainted.

1136
01:45:59.320 --> 01:46:01.120
But we managed
to stop the water.

1137
01:46:02.356 --> 01:46:05.391
We saved the farm.

1138
01:46:05.393 --> 01:46:08.594
Your grandma baked me a cake.
Said I was a hero.

1139
01:46:11.031 --> 01:46:12.765
Later that day we found out

1140
01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:15.201
we blocked
the water all right.

1141
01:46:15.203 --> 01:46:17.703
We sent it upstream.

1142
01:46:17.705 --> 01:46:21.240
The whole lang farm
washed away.

1143
01:46:21.242 --> 01:46:24.243
<i> While I ate my hero cake,</i>
<i> their horses were drowning.</i>

1144
01:46:27.080 --> 01:46:29.882
I used to hear them
wailing in my sleep.

1145
01:46:33.253 --> 01:46:35.221
Did the nightmares
ever stop?

1146
01:46:37.524 --> 01:46:38.891
Yeah.

1147
01:46:39.893 --> 01:46:41.827
When I met your mother.

1148
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:46.665
She gave me faith that
there's good in this world.

1149
01:46:49.069 --> 01:46:51.470
<i> She was my world.</i>

1150
01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.674
I miss you, son.

1151
01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:02.648
I miss you too, dad.

1152
01:47:22.436 --> 01:47:23.869
You know
you can't win this.

1153
01:47:25.772 --> 01:47:27.373
It's suicide.

1154
01:47:30.110 --> 01:47:33.179
I'm older now than
my father ever was.

1155
01:47:35.482 --> 01:47:39.285
This may be the only thing
i do that matters.

1156
01:47:39.287 --> 01:47:43.222
20 years of fighting criminals
amounts to nothing?

1157
01:47:43.224 --> 01:47:45.958
Criminals are
like weeds, Alfred.

1158
01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:48.360
Pull one up,
another grows in its place.

1159
01:47:50.430 --> 01:47:52.631
This is about
the future of the world.

1160
01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:56.035
This is my legacy.

1161
01:47:57.270 --> 01:47:59.638
My father
sat me down right here.

1162
01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:01.807
Told me what Wayne manor
was built on.

1163
01:48:01.809 --> 01:48:05.311
Railroads, real estates,
and oil.

1164
01:48:05.313 --> 01:48:08.981
The first generation
made their fortune
trading with the French.

1165
01:48:08.983 --> 01:48:10.683
Pelts and skins.

1166
01:48:14.488 --> 01:48:16.222
They were hunters.

1167
01:48:32.606 --> 01:48:36.375
So falls
the house of Wayne.

1168
01:48:36.377 --> 01:48:38.177
<i> We gotta</i>
<i> wait for more evidence,</i>

1169
01:48:38.179 --> 01:48:40.145
<i> but the question</i>
<i> still remains,</i>

1170
01:48:40.147 --> 01:48:42.014
<i> where is he?</i>

1171
01:48:42.016 --> 01:48:44.350
<i> If superman</i>
<i> was not involved,</i>

1172
01:48:44.352 --> 01:48:47.720
<i> if he's got nothing to hide,</i>
<i> then why hasn't he been seen</i>

1173
01:48:47.722 --> 01:48:49.655
<i> since the day</i>
<i> of this tragedy?</i>

1174
01:48:49.657 --> 01:48:51.724
<i> You can't</i>
<i> point a finger and...</i>

1175
01:48:51.726 --> 01:48:53.626
<i> I'm not pointing</i>
<i> anything, Warren.</i>
<i> Look. Ten fingers, see?</i>

1176
01:48:53.628 --> 01:48:55.294
<i> If there is</i>
<i> going to be a criminal...</i>

1177
01:50:24.050 --> 01:50:25.851
The night is here.

1178
01:50:56.483 --> 01:50:57.549
Excuse me.

1179
01:50:59.753 --> 01:51:00.986
Don't I know...

1180
01:52:04.084 --> 01:52:07.920
Plain lo in the morning.
Lola in slacks.

1181
01:52:09.156 --> 01:52:10.289
Lois Lane.

1182
01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:14.526
Mmm. Come see the view.

1183
01:52:14.528 --> 01:52:15.728
Um...

1184
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:16.895
Mmm-mmm.

1185
01:52:16.897 --> 01:52:19.098
Now the secret to the height

1186
01:52:19.100 --> 01:52:21.400
is the building material.

1187
01:52:21.402 --> 01:52:24.903
It's light metals which sway
a bit in the wind.

1188
01:52:25.905 --> 01:52:26.972
Hmm.

1189
01:52:29.576 --> 01:52:32.911
And you know something
about lexcorp metals,
don't you, miss Lane?

1190
01:52:32.913 --> 01:52:34.780
I've proven what you've done.

1191
01:52:34.782 --> 01:52:36.882
Wow, you're feisty.

1192
01:52:36.884 --> 01:52:39.384
Unfortunately,
that will blow away.

1193
01:52:39.386 --> 01:52:41.420
Like sand in the desert.

1194
01:52:41.422 --> 01:52:42.554
You're psychotic.

1195
01:52:42.556 --> 01:52:44.022
That is a three-syllable word

1196
01:52:44.024 --> 01:52:46.558
for any thought too big
for little minds.

1197
01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.361
Hmm. Next category: Circles.

1198
01:52:49.363 --> 01:52:54.133
Round and round
and round they go
to find superman.

1199
01:52:54.135 --> 01:52:56.268
Wrong category, boy.
No, no, triangles.

1200
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:57.870
Yes, euclid's
triangle inequality.

1201
01:52:57.872 --> 01:53:00.072
The shortest distance
between any two points

1202
01:53:00.074 --> 01:53:01.874
is a straight path.

1203
01:53:01.876 --> 01:53:04.810
And I believe the straightest
path to superman

1204
01:53:04.812 --> 01:53:06.311
is a pretty little road...

1205
01:53:06.313 --> 01:53:08.747
Mmm.
Called Lois Lane.

1206
01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:32.704
You came back.

1207
01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:34.907
You came back.

1208
01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.361
Boy, do we have
problems up here!

1209
01:54:00.935 --> 01:54:03.335
The problem of...
Of evil in the world.

1210
01:54:03.337 --> 01:54:05.537
Uh, the problem of
absolute virtue.

1211
01:54:05.539 --> 01:54:07.706
I'll take you in
without breaking you.

1212
01:54:07.708 --> 01:54:09.508
Which is more
than you deserve.

1213
01:54:09.510 --> 01:54:11.977
The problem of you
on top of everything else.

1214
01:54:11.979 --> 01:54:13.679
You above all.

1215
01:54:13.681 --> 01:54:16.181
Ah, because
that's what god is.

1216
01:54:16.183 --> 01:54:20.252
Horus. Apollo.
Jehovah. Kal-El.

1217
01:54:21.187 --> 01:54:24.556
Clark Joseph Kent.

1218
01:54:26.326 --> 01:54:30.529
See, what we call god depends
upon our tribe, Clark-Joe.

1219
01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:33.665
Because god is tribal.
God takes sides.

1220
01:54:33.667 --> 01:54:35.667
No man in the sky intervened
when I was a boy

1221
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:38.704
to deliver me from daddy's
fist and abominations. Mmm.

1222
01:54:38.706 --> 01:54:42.507
I figured out way back,
if god is all-powerful,

1223
01:54:42.509 --> 01:54:43.942
he cannot be all-good.

1224
01:54:45.645 --> 01:54:47.212
And if he is all-good,

1225
01:54:47.214 --> 01:54:49.548
then he cannot
be all-powerful.

1226
01:54:49.550 --> 01:54:51.149
And neither can you be.

1227
01:54:52.352 --> 01:54:54.386
They need to see
the fraud you are.

1228
01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:56.288
With their eyes.

1229
01:54:57.557 --> 01:55:00.425
The blood on your hands.

1230
01:55:00.427 --> 01:55:01.593
What have you done?

1231
01:55:01.595 --> 01:55:03.495
Hmm. And tonight,
they will.

1232
01:55:03.497 --> 01:55:07.666
Yes. Because you, my friend,
have a date. Hmm.

1233
01:55:07.668 --> 01:55:09.167
Across the bay.

1234
01:55:09.169 --> 01:55:11.737
Ripe fruit, his hate.
Two years growing.

1235
01:55:11.739 --> 01:55:13.772
But it did not take much
to push him over, actually.

1236
01:55:13.774 --> 01:55:15.340
Little red notes,
big bang.

1237
01:55:15.342 --> 01:55:18.076
You let your family die!

1238
01:55:18.078 --> 01:55:23.782
<i> And now you will fly to him.</i>
<i> And you will battle him.</i>

1239
01:55:23.784 --> 01:55:25.350
To the death.

1240
01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:29.621
Black and blue.
Fight night!

1241
01:55:29.623 --> 01:55:33.125
The greatest gladiator match
in the history of the world.

1242
01:55:33.127 --> 01:55:35.961
God versus man.

1243
01:55:35.963 --> 01:55:38.864
Day versus night.

1244
01:55:38.866 --> 01:55:41.934
Son of Krypton versus
bat of Gotham.

1245
01:55:41.936 --> 01:55:44.202
You think I'll fight him
for you?

1246
01:55:44.204 --> 01:55:46.972
Hmm, yes, I do. I think
you will fight-fight-fight

1247
01:55:46.974 --> 01:55:48.941
for that special lady
in your life.

1248
01:55:48.943 --> 01:55:51.243
She's safe on the ground.
How about you?

1249
01:55:51.245 --> 01:55:54.880
Close, but I am
not talking about Lois.

1250
01:55:54.882 --> 01:55:59.284
No. Every boy's special lady
is his mother.

1251
01:56:04.958 --> 01:56:07.459
Martha, Martha, Martha.

1252
01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:09.428
Hmm.

1253
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:13.398
Why, the mother of a flying
demon must be a witch.

1254
01:56:13.400 --> 01:56:16.268
The punishment for witches,
what is that?

1255
01:56:16.270 --> 01:56:18.403
That's right.
Death by fire.

1256
01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:22.007
Mmm.

1257
01:56:27.981 --> 01:56:30.015
Where is she?

1258
01:56:30.017 --> 01:56:31.817
I don't know!
I would not
let them tell me!

1259
01:56:31.819 --> 01:56:34.319
Uh-uh-uh!
If you kill me,
Martha dies.

1260
01:56:34.321 --> 01:56:36.488
And if you fly away, mmm,
Martha also dies.

1261
01:56:36.490 --> 01:56:39.491
But if you kill the bat...

1262
01:56:39.493 --> 01:56:40.926
Martha lives.

1263
01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:49.101
There we go.
There we go. Hmm.

1264
01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:55.607
And now god
bends to my will.

1265
01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:04.182
Ooh, now the cameras
are waiting at your ship.

1266
01:57:04.184 --> 01:57:06.451
For the world to see
the holes in the holy.

1267
01:57:06.453 --> 01:57:07.953
Yes, the almighty
comes clean

1268
01:57:07.955 --> 01:57:09.321
about how dirty he is
when it counts.

1269
01:57:09.323 --> 01:57:11.023
To save Martha,

1270
01:57:11.025 --> 01:57:12.691
bring me the head
of the bat.

1271
01:57:16.195 --> 01:57:17.496
Ah.

1272
01:57:17.498 --> 01:57:20.365
Mother of god,
would you look at the time?

1273
01:57:20.367 --> 01:57:22.701
When you came here,
you had an hour.

1274
01:57:23.970 --> 01:57:25.871
Now it's less.

1275
01:58:27.533 --> 01:58:29.234
<i> Brooke</i>
<i> Baldwin is on the scene.</i>

1276
01:58:29.236 --> 01:58:31.470
<i> Brooke,</i>
<i> you're live on the air.</i>
<i> What are you seeing?</i>

1277
01:58:31.472 --> 01:58:32.938
There's something
happening at the ship.

1278
01:58:34.440 --> 01:58:37.242
It's sending
massive power surges.

1279
01:58:37.244 --> 01:58:39.077
<i> Police helicopters</i>
<i> surrounding the area.</i>

1280
01:58:39.079 --> 01:58:41.813
<i> They've created</i>
<i> a barricade around</i>
<i> this containment center.</i>

1281
01:58:41.815 --> 01:58:43.415
<i> And we're trying to get</i>
<i> a little bit closer here</i>

1282
01:58:43.417 --> 01:58:45.117
<i> to find out what's going on.</i>

1283
01:58:45.119 --> 01:58:47.119
<i> It is absolute chaos.</i>
<i> You can see that lightning,</i>

1284
01:58:47.121 --> 01:58:48.787
<i> those surges of electricity.</i>

1285
01:58:48.789 --> 01:58:52.057
<i> They seem to be getting</i>
<i> stronger by the minute.</i>

1286
01:58:52.059 --> 01:58:54.793
<i> Daily planet.</i>

1287
01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:59.164
Lois. I have to go to Gotham
to convince him to help me.

1288
01:58:59.166 --> 01:59:00.232
Who?

1289
01:59:02.602 --> 01:59:04.636
Or he has to die.

1290
01:59:04.638 --> 01:59:05.871
Clark.

1291
01:59:09.242 --> 01:59:11.409
No one stays good
in this world.

1292
01:59:20.353 --> 01:59:24.356
<i> But as of right now,</i>
<i> much of the city remains</i>
<i> in the dark tonight.</i>

1293
01:59:24.358 --> 01:59:28.693
<i> Much chaos. Much confusing</i>
<i> happening on the streets</i>
<i> of Metropolis tonight.</i>

1294
01:59:28.695 --> 01:59:30.862
<i> Those helicopters are still</i>
<i> surrounding the area.</i>

1295
01:59:30.864 --> 01:59:33.398
<i> I don't know if you can</i>
<i> still see those</i>
<i> bolts of lightning...</i>

1296
02:01:35.254 --> 02:01:40.292
<i> 2400 hours and 2 minutes.</i>
<i> Subject declining rapidly.</i>

1297
02:01:40.294 --> 02:01:42.360
<i> All procedural interventions</i>
<i> have failed.</i>

1298
02:01:43.229 --> 02:01:44.796
<i> Outcome</i>

1299
02:01:47.400 --> 02:01:48.667
<i> will be death.</i>

1300
02:01:57.343 --> 02:02:00.145
<i> Dr. Silas stone suspending</i>
<i> all clinical protocol.</i>

1301
02:02:00.147 --> 02:02:06.885
<i> Us gov, object 6-19-82</i>
<i> is successfully activated.</i>

1302
02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:29.808
<i> I need a chopper</i>
<i> to Gotham.</i>

1303
02:02:29.810 --> 02:02:31.209
Call the heliport.

1304
02:02:31.211 --> 02:02:32.977
Chopper? We can
barely afford a bicycle.

1305
02:02:32.979 --> 02:02:34.145
You wanna chase a story?

1306
02:02:34.147 --> 02:02:35.447
Go to the ship.

1307
02:02:35.449 --> 02:02:36.815
Superman's probably
there already.

1308
02:02:36.817 --> 02:02:39.584
Perry, it's not
for a story.

1309
02:02:44.457 --> 02:02:46.157
Jenny, get her
a chopper to Gotham.

1310
02:02:46.159 --> 02:02:48.693
And forget the heliport.
Put it on the goddamn roof.

1311
02:02:48.695 --> 02:02:50.195
On the roof, Lois!

1312
02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:54.532
Where are we headed?

1313
02:02:54.534 --> 02:02:55.734
There!

1314
02:03:11.717 --> 02:03:14.753
<i> Well, here I am.</i>

1315
02:03:16.088 --> 02:03:17.455
Bruce. Please.

1316
02:03:19.225 --> 02:03:22.093
I was wrong.
You have to listen to me.

1317
02:03:22.095 --> 02:03:23.328
Lex wants us to...

1318
02:03:38.744 --> 02:03:41.079
You don't understand.

1319
02:03:41.081 --> 02:03:42.447
There's no time!

1320
02:03:44.083 --> 02:03:45.250
<i> I understand.</i>

1321
02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.328
Stay down!

1322
02:05:03.330 --> 02:05:05.763
If I wanted it,
you'd be dead already.

1323
02:05:43.836 --> 02:05:45.136
<i> Breathe it in.</i>

1324
02:05:47.907 --> 02:05:49.774
<i> That's fear.</i>

1325
02:05:52.678 --> 02:05:54.112
<i> You're not brave.</i>

1326
02:05:58.417 --> 02:05:59.951
<i> Men are brave.</i>

1327
02:09:49.715 --> 02:09:54.385
<i> I bet your parents taught you</i>
<i> that you mean something.</i>

1328
02:09:54.387 --> 02:09:56.053
<i> That you're here for a reason.</i>

1329
02:09:57.556 --> 02:10:01.259
<i> My parents taught me</i>
<i> a different lesson,</i>

1330
02:10:01.261 --> 02:10:03.728
<i> dying in the gutter</i>

1331
02:10:03.730 --> 02:10:05.730
<i> for no reason at all.</i>

1332
02:10:22.481 --> 02:10:25.149
<i> They taught me the world</i>
<i> only makes sense</i>

1333
02:10:25.151 --> 02:10:27.218
<i> if you force it to.</i>

1334
02:11:05.557 --> 02:11:07.458
<i> You were never a god.</i>

1335
02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:12.396
<i> You were never even a man.</i>

1336
02:11:19.338 --> 02:11:22.707
You're letting him
kill Martha.

1337
02:11:28.347 --> 02:11:30.147
<i> What does that mean?</i>

1338
02:11:31.350 --> 02:11:32.917
<i> Why did you say that name?</i>

1339
02:11:34.186 --> 02:11:36.754
Find him.

1340
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:39.690
Save

1341
02:11:39.692 --> 02:11:41.392
<i> Martha.</i>

1342
02:11:44.329 --> 02:11:45.730
<i> Martha.</i>

1343
02:12:16.528 --> 02:12:18.429
Martha.

1344
02:12:22.634 --> 02:12:23.801
<i> Why did you say that name?</i>

1345
02:12:25.738 --> 02:12:27.571
<i> Martha!</i>
<i> Why did you say that name?</i>

1346
02:12:27.573 --> 02:12:28.873
Clark! Stop!

1347
02:12:28.875 --> 02:12:30.241
Please! Stop!

1348
02:12:30.243 --> 02:12:31.909
<i> Why did you say that name?</i>

1349
02:12:31.911 --> 02:12:34.378
It's his mother's name!

1350
02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.647
It's his mother's name.

1351
02:13:08.247 --> 02:13:09.780
<i> We're not</i>
<i> getting any answers.</i>

1352
02:13:09.782 --> 02:13:11.315
We're still right outside
the containment center.

1353
02:13:11.317 --> 02:13:12.516
A dangerous situation.

1354
02:13:12.518 --> 02:13:13.951
Military and police personnel

1355
02:13:13.953 --> 02:13:15.519
<i> surrounding the area.</i>

1356
02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:32.303
<i> Luthor.</i>

1357
02:13:32.305 --> 02:13:34.772
He wanted
your life for hers.

1358
02:13:35.974 --> 02:13:37.808
She's losing time.

1359
02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:40.711
The scout ship seems to be
drawing power from the city.

1360
02:13:40.713 --> 02:13:42.279
It's got to be Lex.

1361
02:13:42.281 --> 02:13:45.016
<i> They need you at that ship.</i>
<i> I'll find her.</i>

1362
02:13:45.018 --> 02:13:47.118
My mother needs me.
<i> Wait.</i>

1363
02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.654
<i> I'll make you a promise.</i>

1364
02:13:50.656 --> 02:13:52.923
<i> Martha won't die tonight.</i>

1365
02:14:19.651 --> 02:14:21.018
<i> Master Wayne.</i>

1366
02:14:21.020 --> 02:14:22.253
<i> Alfred.</i>

1367
02:14:22.255 --> 02:14:24.021
Uh, I'm sorry
for listening in,

1368
02:14:24.023 --> 02:14:25.556
but I've tracked
the Russian's phone

1369
02:14:25.558 --> 02:14:27.224
to a warehouse
near the port.

1370
02:14:27.226 --> 02:14:28.759
<i> You're locked onto it.</i>

1371
02:14:28.761 --> 02:14:30.327
<i> I don't deserve you, Alfred.</i>

1372
02:14:30.329 --> 02:14:32.797
No, sir. You don't.

1373
02:14:53.552 --> 02:14:55.486
I'm afraid
this is goodbye.

1374
02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:01.592
And every time
we say goodbye,
you die a little.

1375
02:15:14.739 --> 02:15:16.540
- Take it down.
- Go! Go!

1376
02:15:39.898 --> 02:15:41.232
<i> You have to take it,</i>
<i> Alfred.</i>

1377
02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:43.801
Ah, right.

1378
02:15:43.803 --> 02:15:45.870
Commencing drone mode.

1379
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.674
Thermal imaging
is showing me

1380
02:15:50.676 --> 02:15:53.277
two dozen hostiles
on the third floor.

1381
02:15:53.279 --> 02:15:55.679
Why don't I drop you off
on the second?

1382
02:19:00.765 --> 02:19:02.499
Drop it.

1383
02:19:04.169 --> 02:19:06.070
I said drop it!

1384
02:19:07.038 --> 02:19:08.372
I'll kill her.

1385
02:19:10.208 --> 02:19:12.443
Believe me, I'll do it.

1386
02:19:15.313 --> 02:19:16.447
<i> I believe you.</i>

1387
02:19:28.828 --> 02:19:31.862
<i> It's okay.</i>
<i> I'm a friend of your son's.</i>

1388
02:19:31.864 --> 02:19:34.765
I figured.
The cape.

1389
02:20:02.862 --> 02:20:04.395
"Late, late,"
says the white rabbit.

1390
02:20:04.397 --> 02:20:06.196
<i> 40 seconds to animation.</i>

1391
02:20:06.198 --> 02:20:07.831
Right, wabbit?

1392
02:20:07.833 --> 02:20:11.602
Hmm. Out of tricks,
out of time.

1393
02:20:12.670 --> 02:20:15.172
And one bat head short.

1394
02:20:15.174 --> 02:20:17.007
<i> 30 seconds to animation.</i>

1395
02:20:17.009 --> 02:20:18.776
Ah. That'll be the cook.

1396
02:20:18.778 --> 02:20:19.943
Excuse me.

1397
02:20:19.945 --> 02:20:22.880
Uh, Gotham roast.
Well done.

1398
02:20:22.882 --> 02:20:25.048
Hello. Break the bad news.

1399
02:20:25.050 --> 02:20:27.951
<i> I'd rather do</i>
<i> the breaking in person.</i>

1400
02:20:27.953 --> 02:20:29.686
<i> 20 seconds to animation.</i>

1401
02:20:29.688 --> 02:20:30.754
You've lost.

1402
02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:32.956
I don't know how to lose.

1403
02:20:32.958 --> 02:20:34.124
You'll learn.

1404
02:20:34.126 --> 02:20:35.759
I'll learn.

1405
02:20:35.761 --> 02:20:38.262
I don't hate the sinner.

1406
02:20:38.264 --> 02:20:40.364
- I hate the sin.
<i>- 10 seconds to animation.</i>

1407
02:20:40.366 --> 02:20:43.033
And yours, my friend,
is existing.

1408
02:20:43.868 --> 02:20:45.469
I cannot let you win.

1409
02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:46.737
I gave the bat
a fighting chance
to do it,

1410
02:20:46.739 --> 02:20:47.805
but he was not
strong enough.

1411
02:20:47.807 --> 02:20:49.807
So, if man won't kill god...

1412
02:20:49.809 --> 02:20:51.975
<i> ...two, one.</i>

1413
02:20:53.645 --> 02:20:54.745
...the devil will do it!

1414
02:21:11.464 --> 02:21:12.896
Perry!

1415
02:21:12.898 --> 02:21:15.566
All right.
Stay calm, everybody!

1416
02:21:15.568 --> 02:21:17.000
<i> We're getting reports</i>
<i> there are total blackouts</i>

1417

1421
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:34.685
Hmm. Blood of my blood.

1422
02:21:41.192 --> 02:21:43.360
Born to destroy you.

1423
02:21:46.097 --> 02:21:48.165
Your doomsday.

1424
02:22:11.289 --> 02:22:14.091
Now god is good

1425
02:22:14.626 --> 02:22:16.093
as dead.

1426
02:22:19.298 --> 02:22:20.597
Oh!

1427
02:23:39.711 --> 02:23:41.111
Potus joining.

1428
02:23:41.113 --> 02:23:42.479
Mr. president.

1429
02:23:42.481 --> 02:23:44.147
<i> What the hell</i>
<i> is it, Calvin?</i>

1430
02:23:44.149 --> 02:23:45.816

Are you hurt, ma'am?
I'm okay.

1434
02:24:03.769 --> 02:24:05.502
Good. You're gonna be
all right, okay?

1435
02:24:15.313 --> 02:24:18.181
<i> This thing</i>
<i> emerged from the</i>
<i> Kryptonian crash site</i>

1436
02:24:18.183 --> 02:24:19.983

1437
02:24:19.985 --> 02:24:21.985
<i> Thankfully though,</i>

<i> Those are apache helicopters.</i>

1440

<i> They have now just arrived.</i>
<i> The images that...</i>

1441
02:25:06.998 --> 02:25:10.200
<i> We've, uh...</i>
<i> We just lost connection</i>
<i> with Metropolis 8 news.</i>

1442
02:25:10.202 --> 02:25:12.536
<i> Now, it's not clear</i>

1443
02:25:16.140 --> 02:25:17.708
<i> What's happening there,</i>
<i> Alfred?</i>

1444
02:25:19.545 --> 02:25:21.511
How best to describe it?

1445
02:25:21.513 --> 02:25:23.413
<i> Metropolis airspace</i>
<i> has been closed briefly.</i>

1446
02:25:23.415 --> 02:25:24.981
Excuse me?

02:25:24.983 --> 02:25:25.682
<i> We kindly ask that</i>

1449
02:25:27.052 --> 02:25:28.452
Miss prince?

1450
02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:44.901
Sir. Look,
they've cleared the city.

1451
02:25:44.903 --> 02:25:46.570
Looks like he's taking it
into space.

1452
02:25:46.572 --> 02:25:48.405
We can go
straight to key red,
Mr. president.

1453
02:25:48.407 --> 02:25:50.040
Not yet. Are you crazy?

1454
02:25:50.042 --> 02:25:51.341
They're high enough
that we can nuke 'em

1455
02:25:51.343 --> 02:25:52.709
with no casualties, sir.

1456
02:25:52.711 --> 02:25:55.645
One casualty, Mr. president.
Superman.

1457

<i> God have mercy</i>
<i> on us all.</i>

Key is hot.
Key is hot.

1459
02:26:07.960 --> 02:26:09.993
Red birds are armed
to deploy, sir.

1460
02:26:11.262 --> 02:26:12.562
<i> Fire at will.</i>

1461
02:26:12.564 --> 02:26:14.598
Three, two, one...

02:27:03.614 --> 02:27:04.915
<i> Oh, god.</i>

1463
02:27:27.138 --> 02:27:28.505
Projectile 1. Impact.

1464
02:27:28.507 --> 02:27:30.540
Stryker's island,
east of Metropolis.

1465
02:27:30.542 --> 02:27:31.842
That's uninhabited.

1466
02:27:31.844 --> 02:27:33.376
Projectile 2...

1467
02:27:38.950 --> 02:27:41.151
No apparent reentry.

1468
02:27:41.153 --> 02:27:43.119
<i> Projectile 2?</i>

1469
02:27:43.121 --> 02:27:48.959
Superman, Mr. president.
Projectile 2 was superman.

1470
02:27:48.961 --> 02:27:50.260
Sir.

1471
02:27:50.962 --> 02:27:52.095
It's moving.

1472
02:28:33.537 --> 02:28:35.238
<i> The shockwaves</i>
<i> are getting stronger.</i>

1473
02:28:35.240 --> 02:28:38.408
Every time we hit it,
we make it more powerful.

1474
02:28:38.410 --> 02:28:41.077
We can't attack.

1475
02:28:41.079 --> 02:28:43.546
<i> What are you</i>
<i> saying, Calvin?</i>

1476
02:28:43.548 --> 02:28:45.782
I'm saying it's unkillable.

1477
02:29:13.277 --> 02:29:15.612
Master Wayne,
are you receiving me?

1478
02:29:15.614 --> 02:29:16.780
<i> Alfred.</i>

1479
02:29:16.782 --> 02:29:18.615
<i> It's Kryptonian.</i>

1480
02:29:18.617 --> 02:29:21.318
<i> Only kryptonite weapons</i>
<i> can kill it.</i>

1481
02:29:21.320 --> 02:29:24.487
They might.
If you had any left.

1482
02:29:24.489 --> 02:29:27.958
<i> I got one round left.</i>

1483
02:29:27.960 --> 02:29:32.128
<i> The spear.</i>
<i> Alfred, the spear.</i>
<i> It's pure kryptonite.</i>

1484
02:29:32.130 --> 02:29:33.897
<i> It's back in Gotham.</i>

1485
02:29:33.899 --> 02:29:36.766
<i> If I can penetrate the skin,</i>
<i> the spear will kill it.</i>

1486
02:29:36.768 --> 02:29:38.435
It would in theory.

1487
02:29:38.437 --> 02:29:40.937
<i> I've gotta get it to chase me</i>
<i> back to the city.</i>

1488
02:29:40.939 --> 02:29:42.672
<i> Back to the kryptonite.</i>

1489
02:30:43.334 --> 02:30:44.934
<i> Oh, shit.</i>

1490
02:31:34.352 --> 02:31:36.419
Why did you bring him
back to the city?

1491
02:31:36.421 --> 02:31:37.921
<i> The port is abandoned.</i>

1492
02:31:37.923 --> 02:31:39.789
<i> There's a weapon here</i>
<i> that can kill it.</i>

1493
02:31:52.369 --> 02:31:53.636
Did you find the spear?

1494
02:31:54.605 --> 02:31:56.372
<i> I've been a little busy.</i>

1495
02:31:56.374 --> 02:31:59.676
This thing, this creature,
seems to feed on energy.

1496
02:32:01.745 --> 02:32:04.647
This thing is
from another world.

1497
02:32:05.316 --> 02:32:06.649
My world.

1498
02:32:06.651 --> 02:32:09.319
I've killed things
from other worlds before.

1499
02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:12.155
Is she with you?

1500
02:32:13.124 --> 02:32:15.024
<i> I thought she was with you.</i>

1501
02:35:53.477 --> 02:35:55.011
Clark!

1502
02:35:55.013 --> 02:35:56.379
Clark!

1503
02:36:03.854 --> 02:36:04.921
Clark!

1504
02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.300
Clark!

1505
02:36:17.302 --> 02:36:18.935
Clark! Are you all right?

1506
02:36:56.740 --> 02:36:58.474
I love you.

1507
02:37:02.079 --> 02:37:05.515
No. No, Clark, you can't.

1508
02:37:07.251 --> 02:37:09.185
This is my world.

1509
02:37:09.187 --> 02:37:10.653
No, Clark, don't.

1510
02:37:14.258 --> 02:37:16.626
You are my world.

1511
02:37:16.628 --> 02:37:17.760
No.

1512
02:37:20.931 --> 02:37:22.665
Please. Clark!

1513
02:44:28.625 --> 02:44:29.692
Hi.

1514
02:44:36.700 --> 02:44:39.435
Clark had this sent here,
so he could surprise you.

1515
02:47:06.516 --> 02:47:08.684
"The dead shall live.

1516
02:47:09.519 --> 02:47:12.755
"My slain shall rise again.

1517
02:47:15.725 --> 02:47:18.594
"Awake and sing,
ye that dwell in dust.

1518
02:47:20.030 --> 02:47:23.365
"For thy dew is like
the dew of morning.

1519
02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:30.139
"And the earth
shall give birth
to her dead."

1520
02:47:37.547 --> 02:47:40.215
Ah, I need a ride
back to the house.

1521
02:47:40.217 --> 02:47:42.918
I forgot my checkbook
to pay the funeral director.

1522
02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:45.054
They said it's all
taken care of.

1523
02:47:45.056 --> 02:47:46.121
By whom?

1524
02:47:47.057 --> 02:47:48.791
Anonymous donor.

1525
02:48:32.602 --> 02:48:36.772
All those circuses back east
burying an empty box.

1526
02:48:36.774 --> 02:48:38.841
They don't know
how to honor him,

1527
02:48:39.876 --> 02:48:41.677
except as a soldier.

1528
02:48:43.446 --> 02:48:46.782
I've failed him in life.

1529
02:48:48.251 --> 02:48:52.054
I won't fail him in death.

1530
02:48:52.056 --> 02:48:54.723
Help me find
the others like you.

1531
02:48:54.725 --> 02:48:56.658
Perhaps they don't
want to be found.

1532
02:48:57.594 --> 02:49:00.395
They will.
And they'll fight.

1533
02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:03.565
We have to stand together.

1534
02:49:11.307 --> 02:49:14.543
100 years ago,
i walked away from mankind.

1535
02:49:16.613 --> 02:49:18.580
From a century of horrors.

1536
02:49:22.152 --> 02:49:25.854
Man made a world where
standing together
is impossible.

1537
02:49:28.925 --> 02:49:30.859
Men are still good.

1538
02:49:33.329 --> 02:49:36.231
<i> We fight. We kill.</i>

1539
02:49:37.433 --> 02:49:39.835
<i> We betray one another.</i>

1540
02:49:41.704 --> 02:49:43.772
<i> But we can rebuild.</i>

1541
02:49:45.008 --> 02:49:46.875
<i> We can do better.</i>

1542
02:49:48.144 --> 02:49:50.179
<i> We will.</i>

1543
02:49:50.181 --> 02:49:51.380
<i> We have to.</i>

1544
02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:16.038
The others like me.

1545
02:50:16.040 --> 02:50:18.307
Why did you say
they'll have to fight?

1546
02:50:23.713 --> 02:50:25.948
Just a feeling.

1547
02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:39.761
Prisoner a-c-23-19-40.

1548
02:50:39.763 --> 02:50:42.497
The warden wants
to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1549
02:50:44.100 --> 02:50:46.001
I'm gonna say this
one more time.

1550
02:50:46.003 --> 02:50:48.804
The warden
wants to speak to you,
so stand to your feet.

1551
02:50:56.679 --> 02:50:58.580
Turn around
and face the wall.

1552
02:51:00.617 --> 02:51:03.018
Place your forehead
against the wall.

1553
02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.920
Put your hands
behind your back,

1554
02:51:04.922 --> 02:51:06.989
so that I can come in
and restrain you.

1555
02:51:35.285 --> 02:51:38.220
<i> Whatever you do,</i>
<i> wherever you go,</i>

1556
02:51:38.222 --> 02:51:40.322
<i> I'll be watching you.</i>

1557
02:51:40.957 --> 02:51:42.357
Oh...

1558
02:51:43.793 --> 02:51:45.360
Look at us.

1559
02:51:46.462 --> 02:51:48.764
This is how
it all caves in.

1560
02:51:48.766 --> 02:51:54.169
Civilization on
the Wayne manor's
out the window.

1561
02:51:54.171 --> 02:51:55.737
Mmm?

1562
02:51:58.242 --> 02:52:01.143
But who would believe me?
I...

1563
02:52:01.145 --> 02:52:03.578
I'm insane.

1564
02:52:04.847 --> 02:52:07.015
I'm not even
fit to stand trial.

1565
02:52:07.017 --> 02:52:08.950
That's right.

1566
02:52:08.952 --> 02:52:12.788
We have hospitals that
treat the mentally ill
with compassion.

1567
02:52:14.091 --> 02:52:16.091
But that's not
where you're going.

1568
02:52:16.093 --> 02:52:19.594
I arranged for you
to get transferred
to arkham asylum in Gotham.

1569
02:52:20.997 --> 02:52:23.532
I still have
some friends there.

1570
02:52:23.534 --> 02:52:25.167
They're expecting you.

1571
02:52:29.672 --> 02:52:33.909
But the bell's
already been rung.

1572
02:52:36.379 --> 02:52:37.846
And they've heard it.

1573
02:52:39.682 --> 02:52:41.450
Out in the dark.

1574
02:52:41.452 --> 02:52:44.119
Among the stars. Hmm.

1575
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:50.759
Ding dong,
the god is dead.

1576
02:53:00.136 --> 02:53:02.938
But a bell cannot be unrung!

1577
02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:07.776
He's hungry.
He's found us.

1578
02:53:08.978 --> 02:53:10.746
And he's coming!

1579
02:53:13.883 --> 02:53:16.451
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1580
02:53:18.654 --> 02:53:21.623
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1581
02:53:23.493 --> 02:53:26.795
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,
ding, ding, ding, ding.

1582
02:53:28.097 --> 02:53:31.133
<i> Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1583
02:53:33.169 --> 02:53:37.939
<i> Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,</i>
<i> ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>

1584
02:53:37.941 --> 02:53:41.109
<i> Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding,</i>
<i> ding, ding, ding, ding.</i>
